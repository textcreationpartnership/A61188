            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:37494:5"/>God to take that Excellent Prince to his Mercy. And whereas it is but too evident, that the ſame Helliſh Plot is not entirely extinguiſhed, but that divers of the Wicked Actors in it are ſtill carrying on new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances againſt the Happy Peace of Our Dominions; We cannot but judge it ſeaſonable in this Juncture of Time to have Our Subjects reminded of the Riſe, Progreſs and Miſchievous Deſigns of that deſperate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy.

            <head>A True ACCOUNT OF THE Horrid Conſpiracy Againſt the Late KING, His Preſent MAJESTY, And the GOVERNMENT.</head>
            <p>THE KING has thought fit to lay open, and to declare to the World, An Exact Account of the late Accurſed Conſpiracy, which was actually form'd, and carried on in <hi>England,</hi> and ſet on foot in <hi>Scotland,</hi> againſt His own, and his only and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Brothers Life, and againſt the Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Flouriſhing Government of His Majeſties Kingdoms; as far forth, as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the Particulars of it have come to His Knowledge, by the Voluntary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, or undeniable Convictions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Principal Conſpirators.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:37494:12"/>
            <p>By this faithfully repreſenting the plain Matter of Fact, though perhaps all the Groundleſs Suggeſtions, and Malicious Inſinuations of Factious Men, will not be wholly put to ſilence; it being their old, and conſtant Artifice, to ſupport, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage their Party, by Impudent Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Falſhoods, againſt the cleareſt Light, and moſt evident Proof: Yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever His Majeſty will have the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereby to confirm the Loyalty, and good Affections of all His loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects at Home, and to eſtabliſh Abroad the Reputation, and Honour of His Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Juſtice.</p>
            <p>And moreover (which His Majeſty moſt of all regards) this Publick, and Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Teſtimony will be given of His ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Thankfulneſs to Almighty God, for that Miraculous Deliverance from a Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which came ſo near His Sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and was ſo far ſpread in the Ruine, it threaten'd to all His People.</p>
            <p>It is well known, what miſchievous Arts of late Years have been uſed, and what Treaſonable Courſes taken, to withdraw theſe Nations from their bounden Duty and Allegiance, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe His Majeſties moſt Juſt, and Merciful Government to Calumny and Contempt:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37494:12"/>The Rebellious Deſign having been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently carried on by all ſorts of Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents; whom either their Crimes, or Wants, their furious Zeal, or unbounded Ambition, inclined to wiſh for a Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the Peace, and Proſperity, which His Majeſties Dominions have ſo long injoy'd, to the Envy of all His Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p>To this wicked purpoſe, many the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame fatal Methods and ſpecious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, which, in the Days of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Glorious Father, had involved theſe Kingdoms in Confuſion and Blood, were once again revived, and by many the very ſame Perſons; Men of crafty, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and implacable Spirits; impenitent after the moſt Gracious Pardons; whom long Experience had made skilful in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing weak, and unſtable Minds, by counterfeiting the plauſible Names of things in themſelves moſt excellent, but moſt dangerous when abuſed; ſuch as Liberty, Property, Conſcience, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>By theſe wretched Inſtruments, was this moſt gentle, and benign Government again reproached with Tyranny, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power: The Church of <hi>England</hi> was once more Traduced, as Popiſhly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37494:13"/>affected: The moſt able Officers, and faithfulleſt Servants of the Crown again Reviled, under the odious Title of Evil Councellours.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Sedition and Schiſm were every where promoted; unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fears ſuggeſted; vain Suſpicions of future Dangers augmented to deſtroy the preſent Tranquility; deſperate Speeches, infamous Libels, Traiterous Books ſwarm'd in all places; and under colour of the only True Proteſtant, the worſt of all Unchriſtian Principles were put in practiſe; all the old Republican, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonarchical Doctrines, whoſe Effects had formerly prov'd ſo diſmal, were now again as confidently own'd, and aſſerted, as ever they had been during the hotteſt Rage of the late unhappy Troubles.</p>
            <p>From theſe Preparations to a new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, the Party began by degrees to proceed to Action. Diſtinctions of Sides were made: Names, and Tokens of Separation were given: Illegal Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were maintained, in defiance of the Laws of God, and Man: Tumultuous Feaſts, and Factious Clubs were ſet up in City, and Country: Cloſe, and Seditious Meetings haunted: Frequent Cabals ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and by Men of high degree with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37494:13"/>the loweſt: Great Stores of Arms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by private Perſons: Inſolent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes made through divers Countries; thereby to glory in their Numbers, and to carry far and near the Terrour of their Power, and even to Muſter their Party ready for ſome ſudden Blow, or general Inſurrection.</p>
            <p>All theſe, and many more ſuch Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Indignities, and Publick Aſſaults on the Government, His Majeſty long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured with the ſame Mildneſs, and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, wherewith he had already for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given the higheſt Crimes againſt himſelf; His Royal Goodneſs ſtill patiently expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and wiſhing, that in time the moſt obſtinate of his miſguided Subjects would ſee their Errour, and return at length to a ſenſe of the Duty, they owe him by all the ſtrongeſt Bands of Nature and Laws, Religion and Gratitude, that can poſſibly oblige Subjects towards a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</p>
            <p>But when His Majeſty was abundantly convinc'd that all thoſe dark Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and open Tumults of unruly Men, were but ſo many infallible Signs, and Forerunners of Rebellion, or ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Commotions; Then at laſt, in a tender reſpect to his Peoples Safety,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37494:14"/>more than to his own, was His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty conſtrain'd to awaken his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to try what good Effect the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of his Laws would have on thoſe Offenders, with whom all his repeated Mercy and Indulgence had ſo little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd.</p>
            <p>Yet ſuch was then His Majeſties hard Fortune, ſo firmly combined were the Diſaffected, eſpecially by their Prevalent Intereſt in packing the Juries of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> that whilſt His Majeſty carefully endeavour'd to diſtribute Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Juſtice to all his Subjects, he could not obtain the ſame Right Himſelf; his Enemies ſtill becoming more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and united in thoſe very places, where their deſperate Enterpriſes againſt the Government, were likely to be moſt ſudden and pernicious.</p>
            <p>Amongſt divers other infamous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this Nature, was that of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> the Joyner. For though the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal was ſo mean a Man, and no other ways conſiderable, but for his audacious Forwardneſs in affronting the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet His Majeſty, with all His Royal Authority, could hardly prevail to have him brought to a Fair and Legal Tryal. Nor had His Majeſty been able at laſt to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37494:14"/>procure ſo much Juſtice to be done, had not the Proceſs been removed into another County, where (the Rulers of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction being leſs powerful,) that new and damnable Opinion and Practice of the Lawfulneſs of Equivocating and even of Perjury for the <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> had not prevailed over the old and honeſt Engliſh Principles of Truth and Honour.</p>
            <p>However though in the end His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Juſtice got the better at that time, yet it was defeated in a greater, and more important Inſtance, that of the late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury;</hi> who had been long and reaſonably ſuſpected, and in the iſſue was manifeſtly diſcovered to be the chief Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and ſupreme Manager of all theſe Traiterous Contrivances againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Crowns and Life.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Earl His Majeſty had formerly pardon'd, inrich'd, enobled, and advanc'd to one of the higheſt Stations in the Kingdom; by a long Succeſſion of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Bounties, endeavouring to render his Abilities, and Experience in Buſineſs, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to his King, and beneficial to his Country.</p>
            <p>Yet ſo treacherous and undermining was his Genius; ſo unmeaſurable his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; ſo impatient of quiet, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37494:15"/>Courſes; ſo much fitter he was to be the Inſtrument of a Tyrant, than the Servant of a Juſt and Good Prince; that after many hainous Infidelities and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences committed by him, and forgiven by his Majeſty, he was at length neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to diſcharge him his Service; yet ſo as to leave him one of the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Peers in the Kingdom for Title and Eſtate.</p>
            <p>But his aſpiring and revengeful Spirit could not brook ſo gentle a diſgrace. Wherefore having deſervedly been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd the Court, he preſently attempted to ſet the Country directly againſt it. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately he profeſs'd himſelf the moſt zealous true Proteſtant, and the greateſt Patriot; Thereby ſlily inſinuating his deſigns into the Heads of all Sects and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions in Church and State: To them betraying ſome, vilifying others; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly interpreting all His Majeſties Counſels; Making thoſe very Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and reſolutions of State, whereof he had been the chief Adviſer, when he was in Power, to be the principal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt the Government, when he was diſplaced.</p>
            <p>Thus he and his party went boldly on to diſturb the Publick Quiet, and to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37494:15"/>affront His Majeſties Authority with the higheſt Inſolence: In Words and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings defaming it, as Arbitrary and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical, whilſt in Deeds he inſulted over it, as believing it to be weak, and reſolving to make it deſpicable. And all this with a ſecure confidence not only of Indemnity, but Succeſs; Knowing himſelf to be under the protection of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his own appointment, or approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And therefore preſuming he was far out of the reach of His Majeſties juſt Indignation.</p>
            <p>And ſo for a time it unhappily proved. For being legally indicted of Crimes of the higheſt Nature; though the Evidence againſt him was cleer, and poſitive; ſome of the Witneſſes being the very ſame Men, whoſe Teſtimony had been approv'd of, in the proſecution of <hi>Oats</hi>'s Plot; And the very Original draught of a treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Aſſociation having been actually found in his Cuſtody; yet he could not be brought to a Lawful Trial by his Peers, the Indictment being ſtifled by a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Ignoramus;</hi> and that accompanied with ſo much Inſolence, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Miniſters of His Majeſties Juſtice were in much more danger than the Criminal, and hardly eſcap'd the rude
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37494:16"/>Aſſaults of his Confederates and Party.</p>
            <p>However, from ſo great a Violation of Common Right, and of the Royal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, His Majeſty gain'd this very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Advantage, That thenceforth he plainly perceived the main Strength of all his Enemies Arrogance lay in their Extravagant Power to pack the City-Juries. For what Treaſon might not the Earl of <hi>Shatftsbury</hi> ſecurely Project, or <hi>Ferguſon</hi> Write, or an Aſſociation Act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Government, whilſt <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and a ſetled Club, was at hand with their Corrupt Pannels, to Indemnifie, and if need were, to ſecond and applaud their moſt Villanous Practices?</p>
            <p>Wherefore His Majeſty foreſeeing how deſtructive, in time, the Effects of ſo great and growing a Miſchief would be, reſolved at length, after a many Intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Provocations, to ſtrike at that which he had now found to be the very Root of the Faction.</p>
            <p>This His Majeſty, and all wiſe and good Men perceiv'd, could be no other ways done, than firſt by reducing the Elections of the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> to their Antient Order and Rules, that of late were become only a Buſineſs of Clamour and Violence: And then to make Inquiry into the Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37494:16"/>of the City-Charter it ſelf; which an ill Party of Men had abuſed to the Danger, and would have done it to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Government, had they been ſuffer'd to go on never lb little farther uncontroul'd.</p>
            <p>In both theſe moſt juſt and neceſſary Undertakings, the Righteouſneſs of His Majeſties Cauſe met with an anſwerable Succeſs. Firſt, notwithſtanding all the Tumultuous Riots the Factious Party committed, to diſturb the peaceable Iſſue of that Affair; yet the undoubted Right of the Lord Mayor's Nominating the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Sheriff, was reſtored and eſtabliſhed: And ſo the Adminiſtration of Juſtice once more put in a way of being cleared from Partiality and Corruption. And then a due Judgment was obtain'd, by an equal Proceſs of Law, againſt the Charter it ſelf, and its Franchiſes declared forfeited to his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>But though this happy Event of His Majeſties Controverſie with the diſaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part of the City of <hi>London,</hi> was in all Humane probability, the only effectual Courſe to provide for the future Peace, and Stability of the Government; yet it had like to have proved a preſent Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its utter Ruine.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:37494:17"/>
            <p>For when ſo many guilty Perſons found, that the great Point of the Sheriffs was reſetled on its Antient Bottom, and the City-Charter it ſelf in hazard of being ſpeedily vacated; ſo that now there would be no farther evaſion for them, by any pretence of Law, to eſcape unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd: Then they concluded it was high time to bring their Deviliſh Purpoſes to a quicker iſſue, and once for all to ſtrike boldly at the Heart of the KING and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Particularly the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> being conſcious to himſelf of the blackneſs of his Crimes, and of the Iniquity of the Verdict, by which he had for that time eſcaped; and finding he was now within the compaſs of the Juſtice he had ſo lately fruſtrated and contemn'd, thenceforth gave over all his quieter and more plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Arts of Sedition, whereby he proudly bragg'd he ſhould, in time, as his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion was, <hi>Leiſurely walk his Majeſty out of his Dominions;</hi> and on a ſudden betook himſelf to more precipitate En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes: Alarming his Companions with a proſpect of their common danger; thence inflaming ſome to Inſurrections, others to Aſſaſſinations; ſuppoſing now there was no way left for him, or them,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37494:17"/>to juſtifie their former Miſdemeanors and Treaſons, but by attempting and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in greater Miſchiefs.</p>
            <p>This was found by evident Proof to have been the principal riſe and occaſion of ripening the Horrid Conſpiracy in the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> Nor could there poſſibly have happen'd a ſtronger Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of His Majeſties Counſels in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to rectifie the City-Juries and Elections; ſince it is apparent his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Enemies laid ſo much ſtreſs on the unjuſt Power they had therein uſurp'd, that, being once fairly driven from that Strength, they immediately reſolv'd, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than a barefac'd and avow'd Rebellion could repair the Loſs their Party ſuſtain'd by ſo great a Blow.</p>
            <p>As for His Majeſties Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it is notorious there has been long ſhelter'd in it a deſperate Faction of furious Zealots, that under the old Profeſſions of the Cauſe of Chriſt, and a purer way of Goſpel-Worſhip, has grown up by degrees to a Violation at laſt, not only of all the Rules and Inſtitutions of true Religion, but of common Humanity. For does not the whole Chriſtian World at this day behold with Horror, that the moſt Villa nous Tenets of the fierceſt Scottiſh Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37494:18"/>and even of their Remonſtrators, have been out-done by their Succeſſors and Diſciples in the Field-Meetings, and Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conventicles? Have they not thence proceeded to all the Execrable Rage of Rapine and Violence? In ſo much that ſome of them have lived and died glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the moſt barbarous Murders, and baſeſt Cruelties; refuſing obſtinately with their laſt Breath, ſo much as to pray for His Majeſty, or to ſay, <hi>God ſave the King;</hi> though by an unexampled Mercy, they had their Pardons aſſur'd to them at the very place and moment of their Execution, upon that ſingle Condition.</p>
            <p>And beſides the remains of thoſe Bloody Enthuſiaſts, whoſe Principles are not yet entirely extinguiſh'd, though their force has been twice vanquiſh'd in open Field, by Gods Providence proſpering His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Arms; It is certain alſo the Peace of that Kingdom has of late been much indanger'd by other great Numbers of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious and Seditious Spirits, who, though at firſt they would not venture to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage publickly the others declared Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet ſtuck not ſecretly to favour and foment their Cauſe, and as the event infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly proves, would ſoon have Own'd and Headed their Fury, had it proſper'd.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:37494:18"/>
            <p>Wherefore the wiſe care of former Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Parliament there, having ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently provided by a due ſeverity of Good Laws, againſt the dreadful Conſequences of continuing the Field-Meetings; for the farther ſecuring the Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Antient Rights of the Crown and the Royal Family in that Kingdom, it was judg'd adviſeable, by the Wiſdom of His Majeſties great Council, the laſt Seſſion of Parliament, to appoint and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe a Solemn Teſt to be taken by all Perſons in place of publick Truſt, or Power.</p>
            <p>In that Seſſion the Teſt was ſoon paſs'd into an Act of State, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable oppoſition: Though there were not wanting ſome turbulent Men in the Aſſembly, who took that occaſion of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how ill they were affected to the eſtabliſh'd Government of their Country; Which they could have no other induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be, but either a deſire of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, by reaſon of the deſperate State of their own ill-ſpent Fortunes, or Envy at the better Condition of Honeſter Men, or ſome inveterate Contagion of Treaſon, derived down to them from the laſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Age of Confuſions.</p>
            <p>Of that unquiet and ſeditious Party,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37494:19"/>the chief and declared Head was the late Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> who during the very ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Parliament, had, by many indirect ways, attempted to hinder His Majeſties Service; the ſaid Earl, and the then Preſident of the Seſſion, and their Complices taking their opportunity, in wording the Teſt, to add thereto all the very ſame Clauſes, that have ſince giver any Colour of ſcruple to themſeves. But when all his crafts for obſtructing the Bill were defeated by the far greater Number of well diſpoſed Members, the Loyal Voters for it being at leaſt Ten to one of the diſaffected; then no ſooner was the Parliament adjourn'd, but the ſaid Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> firſt at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> next in traverſing ſeveral Shires, did make it his Chief Buſineſs to inſinuate every where, into the minds of the Clergy and Laity, the moſt malicious prejudices imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble againſt the whole Tenour of the Teſt.</p>
            <p>And afterwards on his return to <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> he often preſumptuouſly declared, he would either not take it at all, or take it only with a reſerve of his own expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; which, he put in Writing and diſpers'd: the contrivance of it being ſuch, as diſſolves all the Obligations of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37494:19"/>the Oath, and makes his own preſent Fancy and private Opinion, the only Standard, whereby he meant to be guided in all the publick Duties of his Loyalty and Allegiance.</p>
            <p>At length His Majeſties High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner the <hi>Duke,</hi> and the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of that Kingdom, having been well inform'd of the ſaid Earls ſeditious Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in City and Country, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully confirm'd in their Judgments and Confidences of his Trayterous Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, in that fallacious and equivocating Paraphraſe on the Teſt, which he own'd in their preſence, perverting thereby the ſound ſenſe, and eluding the force of His Majeſties Laws, in order to ſet the Subjects looſe from their Obedience, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate Schiſm in the Church, and Faction in the State: Upon theſe Grounds, he was moſt deſervedly Proſecuted by His Majeſties Advocate, before the Soveraign Juſtice-Court, according to the known Laws of his Country; and after a full and equal Tryal, he was found guilty of Treaſon, by the Learned Judges, and a Jury hot only of his Peers, but alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them his own neareſt Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Soon after Judgment given, albeit the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37494:20"/>King was far from any thought of taking away his Life, and that no farther pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice was deſign'd againſt him, but the forfeiture of ſome Jurisdictions and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorities, which he and his Predeceſſors had ſurreptitiouſly acquired, and moſt tyrannically exercis'd; beſides the diſpoſal of part of his Eſtate to pay his juſt Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and ſome few moderate Donatives to thoſe, whom he and his Father had formerly ruin'd for their Fidelity to His Majeſty, the Surpluſage being intended entirely to return, and deſcend to his Family; yet the ſaid Earl abuſing the great Freedom indulg'd him in Priſon, (which he enjoy'd as largely after his Condemnation, as before) fled from His Majeſties Mercy, the knowledge of his own Guilt not ſuffering him to venture on that Clemency, whereof he had before participated ſo plentifully, when he was under the like Sentence of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>The King however, notwithſtanding this new Provocation, ſtill retain'd the ſame benign thoughts of favouring his Wife and Children. And before it was known that the ſaid Earl had more Debt on his Eſtate than the full value of it amounted to, (which really was his Caſe)
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37494:20"/>His Majeſty was graciouſly pleas'd, in one Royal Largeſs, to give thrice more of the Inheritance to his Poſterity, than their Father could lawfully have done, had it never been forfeited.</p>
            <p>But how ill he deſerved, or requited ſo many Acts of Grace and Bounty, will appear by the ſequel of his Behaviour after his Eſcape. For in ſtead of doing what his Complices and Dependants gave out he intended, that he would humbly caſt himſelf at His Majeſties Feet, and implore his Pardon, which he, of all Men living, had no reaſon to think deſperate, he is no where to be found, but aſſociating with His Majeſties implacable Enemies in the Head of new Machinations of Treaſon, employs his Liberty abroad in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Traiterous Correſpondences at Home, with reſtleſs Malice exciting the wicked Conſpirators of both Kingdoms to a fatal Union againſt the Life, Government and Family of his Liege Soveraign and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor.</p>
            <p>And all this is to be proved upon him by Arguments as clear as the Sun, by the Credit of his own Authentick Letters, and by the plain Depoſitions of his principal Meſſengers and Agents in the whole Villany.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:37494:21"/>
            <p>By this brief Recollection of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled State of Affairs, and the Tumultuous Temper of ill Mens Minds, in His Majeſties Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> about the time when this treaſonable Conſpiracy was in agitation, the impartial World may perceive, from what deſtructive feeds of Sedition, private Paſſions and Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, under the diſguiſe of Religion and the publick Intereſt, ſo Monſtrous a Birth was produced.</p>
            <p>In the wonderful Diſcovery of which deteſtable Confederacy, and in the happy Prevention of its dire Effects, as all who have heard of it, muſt acknowledge that a ſignal care of Gods Providence has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, for His Majeſties and theſe Nations Preſervation: So His Majeſty gives the Sacred Word and Proteſtation of a King, that nothing has been done, on his part, but what was agreeable to that Royal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity and Natural Candor of his whole Life, whereof all the World, even his Enemies, have had ſuch undoubted Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
            <p>The Evidence was, moſt of it, deliver'd in His Majeſties own preſence. The Examinations were taken by Men of unqueſtionable Reputation and Honour. The whole Proceeding has been managed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37494:21"/>with all imaginable Integrity. There has been no ſtraining or extorting of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations to blemiſh the Fame of the Innocent: No Temptation of Rewards propoſed: No Pardon aſſured before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, for diſcovering or aggravating the Crimes of the Guilty.</p>
            <p>Some Witneſſes, who offer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, of whom there might have been any colourable Suſpicion, His Majeſty wholly rejected: Leſt it ſhould once again happen, that the Waſted Credit, or needy Condition , or profligate Lives of the Perſons depoſing ſhould derogate from the ſtrength of their Depoſitions, and adminiſter any the leaſt doubt of Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Witneſſes His Majeſty admitted had been generally Men ſtrongly prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd in Conſcience, Zeal and Intereſt for that Party: Men whoſe former avow'd Hatred of the Government was reaſon ſufficient to gain them an abſolute truſt with any, who ſtudied to overthrow it. They were not of deſperate Fortunes; Nor deſpicable Men. For the moſt part they ſeparately and ſingly brought in their Diſcoveries. Divers of them had little or no Converſation or Familiarity one with another. There was no ſhadow,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37494:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>or poſſibility of a combination between them all to diſcover; yet ſuch is the prevalence of Self-conviction, and ſo great the Power of Truth , that all their ſeveral Diſcoveries did perfectly agree with themſelves and with each other in all material parts and circumſtances.</p>
            <p>It was therefore in the Summer of the Year 1683, a time when all His Majeſties Dominions injoyed a ſetled Peace, and profound ſecurity, whilſt the greateſt part of the Neighbouring World was involved in Wars and Combuſtions, that His Majeſty and his Council were ſuddenly awaken'd with the ſurprizing Knowledge of this dreadful Conſpiracy, which had been laying very deep and broad for many Months before.</p>
            <p>The Man whom God choſe to make the firſt Diſcoverer, was <hi>Joſiah Keeling,</hi> Citizen and Salter of <hi>London.</hi> A Perſon of good Credit in the common Buſineſs of his Calling: but otherwiſe a moſt perverſe Fanatick; ſo fiercely addicted to their Cauſe , that he had been one of the buſieſt Sticklers in all the late Publick Oppoſitions againſt the Government. Particularly , he was the very Man who undertook, and perform'd the moſt inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Aſſault upon Authoriy, that perhaps
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37494:22"/>the Party ever attempted in full Peace; which was the Arreſting the Lord Mayor, in open Day, in the midſt of the City of <hi>London,</hi> for refuting to admit the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Sheriffs, who had been choſen by thoſe Meetings of the Factious in and about the City, that the Law has ſince condemn'd as Unlawful and Riotous.</p>
            <p>However, by ſo eminent and bold a piece of Service, together with his former approved Activity and Violence for the diſcontented Intereſt, was <hi>Keeling</hi> judg'd by the chief Conſpirators fitly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifi'd to be admitted into their moſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conſultations. And accordingly thereafter they truſted him, as one of their ſureſt Confidents. In ſo much that he was invited to make one of the Forty Miſcreants, whoſe proper part it was to Aſſaſſinate His Majeſties and his Royal Highneſſes Perſons.</p>
            <p>Of which Number after he had freely conſented to be, and had met and acted jointly with the reſt for ſome time, to prepare the curſed Work for a ſpeedy Execution; it pleaſed the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo to touch his Soul with the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of ſo amazing a Crime , that he could not reſt Day nor Night, till after much conflict in his Mind, he had fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37494:23"/>to diſcharge his Conſcience of the Helliſh Secret.</p>
            <p>Wherefore having firſt Communicated ſome part of his burden to one Mr. <hi>Peckam</hi> his private Friend, who had often before warn'd him in general of the dangerous courſe he was in, by ſo deeply ingaging in all the former Seditious Intrigues, he was by him directed to addreſs himſelf to the Lord <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> one of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Privy Council, who remitted him to Sir <hi>Leolyn Jenkins,</hi> Principal Secretary of State, before whom he gave his firſt Information upon Oath, and in due form of Law, on the Twelfth of <hi>June</hi> in that Year.</p>
            <p>But the intended Aſſaſſination, upon the firſt diſcloſing of it, appear'd to be ſo prodigious a Barbarity, that His Majeſty for ſome time gave but very little Ear, and ſlow Credit to this Information, as little ſuſpecting as deſerving ſuch uſage from the worſt of his Subjects.</p>
            <p>Which generous Caution that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty took, not to be impos'd on by New Rumours of Plots, and his Gracious Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs not to believe ſo ill of his very Enemies, but upon certain Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was one of the chief Occaſions, that divers of the principal Agitators and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37494:23"/>Managers of the whole buſineſs, took the Alarm, and got time to ſcatter and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw beyond the Seas.</p>
            <p>However, by Gods Providence conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually watching over His Majeſties and theſe Nations ſafety, ſo many of the Traytors ſoon after fell into the Hands of Juſtice, who did either voluntarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their being Partakers of the Treaſon, or were Convicted of it by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Proof; that henceforth whoever ſhall pretend not to believe the Truth of the whole, they muſt either be ſuch as were Parties in the Deſign, or ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly unreaſonable, as to believe there never can be a Real Plot againſt any Prince or State, but what does actually ſucceed and take effect.</p>
            <p>Thus much is certain of this Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and it is ſo remarkable and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, that perhaps the like cannot be affirm'd of any other mention'd in all Hiſtory, that there was ſcarce a Man At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, or Executed for it, who did not, more or leſſ, add ſome new Light to the ſeveral parts of the dark Contrivance; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a plain Confeſſion of it, or by their very manner of denying it; and by the weakneſs of the Subterfuges, whereby they endeavour'd to palliate their Crimes.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:37494:24"/>
            <p>Upon the whole Matter, though His Majeſty doubts not but the Treaſonable Infection was, in ſome degree or other, ſpread into moſt Quarters of theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, amongſt the Ringleaders of the Republican Clubs, and lawleſs Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles in Town and Country; there being no reaſon for any Man to think otherwiſe, ſince it was the uſual boaſt of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Factors , That more than Twenty Thouſand Perſons were made privy to the very beginnings of it, before the late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Flight: Yet His Majeſty utterly abhorring that bare Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, though never ſo probably grounded, ſhould prevail to conclude any Man Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, has reſolved no Reflection ſhall be made on the Fame of any, but only ſuch, whoſe part in it was made out by poſitive Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>And in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> who during his time, was the Prime Engineer in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving and directing all the ſeveral Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Parts of the whole Conſpiracy; next under him, the Perſons who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Judicially found to have been deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd as Actors, ſome in the Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection part, others in the Aſſaſſination, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them in both together, are theſe,</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:37494:24"/>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> whom the Factious Party had long Corrupted, and Alienated from his Duty and Gratitude to the King and his Royal Highneſs, by ſuggeſting and increaſing in him ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Fears, and poys'ning his Mind with unjuſt and forbidden Hopes.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Wark,</hi> who for ſome Years had been ingaged in the moſt furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deſigns of the Faction; of late eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, after he found that the Wickedneſs of his private Life could neither be ſo well hidden, or go unpuniſh'd in a quiet State as in publick Diſturbances.</p>
            <p>The late Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> whoſe dark and turbulent Spirit and inſatiable Ambition had carry'd him on to be one of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Authors of all the late Deſtractions in Publick Councils and Popular Heats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Government: Till after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch ill Practices, unworthy the Son of ſuch a Father, God left him at laſt to fall into this Precipice; and permitted him to puniſh himſelf for it more ſeverely than the King could ever have found in his Heart to do, had he but given His Majeſty time to make uſe of the excellent Goodneſs of his Nature.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Eſcrick,</hi> who had always been a buſie Promoter of Fanatical
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37494:25"/>and Republican in Projects for Alterations in Church and State; and was therefore for a time the ſecond Favourite of the Diſaffected , whilſt he was Impriſon'd with the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> Nor did they ever make any Objections againſt the Honeſty of his private Life, till he came to the honeſteſt part of it.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Raſſel,</hi> a Perſon carried away beyond his Duty and Allegiance into this Traiterous Enterpriſe, by a vain Air of Popularity , and a wild Suſpicion of loſing a great Eſtate by an imaginary return of Popery; whereby he was the more caſily ſeduced by the wicked Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of that moſt Unchriſtian Doctrine, which has been the cauſe of ſo many Rebellions, and was ſo conformable to his Presbyterian Education, That <hi>it is lawful to Reſiſt and Riſe againſt Soveraign Princes for preſerving Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Algernoon Sidney,</hi> who from his Youth had profeſt himſelf an Enemy to the Government of his Country, and had acted accordingly. As he lived, ſo he died, a Stubborn, Aſſertor of the <hi>Good Old Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>John Hambden</hi> the Younger, who has renew'd, and continued the Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Malignity of his Houſe againſt the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37494:25"/>Royal Family; his Grandfather having been the moſt Active Inſtrument to widen the Breach between the late Bleſſed KING, and the ſeduced part of his People. The Uſurper <hi>Cromwel</hi> of en own'd, That Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> was the very Man who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to oppoſe the Juſtice and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of His Majeſties Cauſe, with an affected Zeal of Conſcience and pure Religion.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong,</hi> a Debauch'd Atheiſtical Bravo; one of thoſe, who with an Hypocriſie peculiar to this Age, would have paſs'd for the moſt forward Reformers of Church and State; whilſt they themſelves both in their Practiſe and Opinions, were the greateſt Corrupters of Virtue, and all Good Manners.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Walcot,</hi> an Old Officer in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Army; who after Pardon and Indemnity receiv'd, and a plentiful Eſtate ſecured to him by His Majeſties moll Happy Return, yet was actually ingaged in all the Plots againſt the Government ever ſince: Particularly in that of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſome Years ago, to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin.</hi> He was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> under the Character of a Stout and Able Officer, into a ſtrict Familiarity with the Earl of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37494:26"/>
               <hi>Shaftsbury;</hi> from whom he never after parted till his Death; accompanying him in his Flight into <hi>Holland,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning thence with his Corps; he and <hi>Ferguſon</hi> having this peculiar Mark of his Kindneſs, to be named Legatees in his Laſt Will and Teſtament, as his ſpecial Friends.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>John Romzey,</hi> who had gotten Credit abroad in <hi>Portugal,</hi> by his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Skill in Military Affairs. He was recommended to the Earl of <hi>Shaftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> as a Soldier of Fortune, reſolute and fit for his turn, in any deſperate Attempt. By His Majeſties Favour, upon his Royal Highneſs's Interceſſion, he got poſſeſs'd of a very conſiderable Office in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of <hi>Briſtol;</hi> which having ſold, he afterwards moſt ungratefully became the ſaid Earls entire Cteature and Dependant. Nor was he ever a profeſs'd Papiſt, as, ſince his Confeſſion, the Party has given out that he was, according to their wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Impudence of Lying.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Shepard</hi> Merchant of the City of <hi>London,</hi> one of a plentiful Eſtate, and eminent Repute, as any of his Rank on the <hi>Exchange:</hi> But a Violent Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt, and Diſciple of <hi>Ferguſon</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>The two <hi>Goodenoughs, Richard</hi> and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37494:26"/>
               <hi>Francis,</hi> both Notorious Enemies of the Eſtabliſh'd Government in Church and State. During all the time of the Factious Citizens moſt furious Eruptions againſt Authority, they had been both, for ſome Years, by turns, Under-Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex;</hi> ſo that the whole wicked Myſtery and Trade of packing the <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus</hi> Juries paſs'd through their Hands.</p>
            <p>Major <hi>Holms,</hi> a Fifth-Monarchy-Man, an old Army-Officer, a Confident of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s, and Truſtee for his Family. In the late Times of Uſurpation he was a Major in the Engliſh Army in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he became acquainted with the Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle,</hi> and was ſince made intimate to all his Treaſonable Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard Rumbald</hi> Maltſter, another old Anny-Officer, a deſperate and bloody <hi>Ravilliac,</hi> who had often before laid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns for the KlNG's Murder, which God as often prevented by ſome ſignal Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> a furious Fanatick, who amongſt many other Seditious Practices, was a Factious Solicitor for <hi>College</hi> the the Joyner: and with unparalell'd boldneſs dared to menace the Government, and to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37494:27"/>put a Libel into that notorious Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors hands, before the Judges faces, at the very time of his Tryal: for which High Miſdemeanor, he has ſince fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cenſure of the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Hone,</hi> a Joyner, a melancholy Enthuſiaſt, of <hi>College</hi>'s Trade and Spirit; who beſides a large Confeſſion of his and others ſhare in this Conſpiracy, did alſo frankly own at his Tryal and Death, that many Years before he had propoſed and deſign'd the Killing of the King out of <hi>Bow-Steeple,</hi> as His Majeſty was paſſing to <hi>Guild-Hall.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>Zachary Bourn,</hi> a Brewer, Son to an obſtinate Independent, and he himſelf one of <hi>Ferguſon</hi>'s Hoſts and Familiars. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Lea</hi> a Dyer, <hi>Andrew Barber,</hi> both Anabaptiſts. However theſe three laſt mention'd did in ſome meaſure expiate their Guilt, by their ingenious and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Confeſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Ayloff</hi> a Lawyer, the very Man who in a ſpightful defiance of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Government, did many Years ſince venture to put a French Wooden Shooe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Speakers Chair of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37494:27"/>Nor has the reſt of his Life ſince come ſhort of the inſufferable Inſolence of that Action.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſeph Tyley, Edward Norton, Edward Wade, Richard Nelthrop, Robert Weſt,</hi> all of them Republican Lawyers, their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the Government tranſporting them to be Factious, againſt the known Intereſt of their own Profeſſion. Theſe were all Men of Crafty Heads, and Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tongues; reſtleſſ Spreaders of falſe News, bold Talkers in Seditious Clubs; where, according to the corrupt faſhion of thoſe Times, the moſt profligate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all Conditions were wont openly to Arraign the Monarchy, and vilifie the Church, under the fair ſhows of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both, and a tender Concernment for the Publick Good.</p>
            <p>Next, in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Names of the chief Inſtruments, who are already proved to have tranſacted that part of the Conſpiracy under the Conduct and Influence of the late Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and who ſince, well nigh all to a Man, but thoſe that eſcaped on the firſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Diſcovery, have made am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Declarations of their Guilt, are theſe,</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> and Sir <hi>John Campbell,</hi> near
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37494:28"/>Relations of the ſaid Earls, and as much the profeſs'd Enemies of their Countries Peace and Government.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Cockran,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Baillie,</hi> Men egregiouſly diſaffected to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and therefore of conſiderable Intereſt with its moſt deſperate Enemies in both Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Theſe, together with <hi>Monroe,</hi> were the Perſons deſired by the Engliſh Managers, to come up to <hi>London,</hi> and Treat of a Joint Conſpiracy with their Brethren here, under the diſguiſe of Planting <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina.</hi> At the ſame time Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Walcot</hi> was call'd out of <hi>Ireland</hi> for the ſame end, but under colour of being the intended Governour of that Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To this purpoſe they were firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited hither by the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and after his Death again ſent for by a Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Meſſenger. Accordingly they actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally came up and Negotiated here ſome time, in order to a firm Conjunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Traytors of both Nations for a general Riſing. Nor was the Treaty wholly broke off, or adjuſted, at the very time when the Diſcovery broke forth.</p>
            <p>To theſe are to be added, <hi>James Steuart,</hi> Son to Sir <hi>James Steuart</hi> ſometimes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37494:28"/>of <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> He was fitted for ſuch a deſign by his hot and fiery Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and by his Education, and his Fathers Example; who together with moſt of his Relations, were violent Covenanters. This Man was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Libel call'd, <hi>The Scottiſh Grievances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> deſcended from Progenitors of ſuch Principles as have been ever againſt the <hi>Crown,</hi> when they have fancied their Kings not Zealous for the Reformation. This Man had the Management of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Affairs in <hi>Scotland</hi> many Years: And when the Duke march'd againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels near <hi>Bothwel-Bridge,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Melvil</hi> (as the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had advis'd) ſent to them to Capitulate, aſſuring them, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> had Orders to give them good Conditions; and when they would not ſubmit, <hi>Melvil</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard to ſay, <hi>That all was loſt:</hi> For the Beating of them would loſe the ſaid Duke with his Friends in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> of <hi>Polwart,</hi> who kept Correſpondence with <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> many Years, and had been formerly Impriſon'd in <hi>Scotland</hi> for Traiterous Expreſſions.</p>
            <p>—<hi>Pringle</hi> Laird of <hi>Tordwoodlie,</hi> a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37494:29"/>noted Fanatick, and of Antimonarchical Principles from his Infancy.</p>
            <p>—<hi>Denham</hi> of <hi>Eaſt-Sheels,</hi> juſt ſuch another, but leſs cautious, and more headſtrong.</p>
            <p>—<hi>Montgomery</hi> of <hi>Lenſhaw,</hi> a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanter to the higheſt degree of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gottry.</p>
            <p>Commiſſary <hi>Monroe,</hi> who had well ſerv'd His Majeſty in the Wars, as an active, brave Man: But upon ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries he pretended to have receiv'd from the Duke of <hi>Lauderdail,</hi> he grew enrag'd to ſuch a degree, as led him into theſe Courſes; which now make him ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie to himſelf, that he has often begg'd of his Keeper to kill him, for ſuch an ungrateful Wretch ſhould not live.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hugh Scot</hi> Laird of <hi>Gallowſheels, James Murray</hi> Laird of <hi>Philiphaugh,</hi> both zealous Sticklers for the Field-Conventicle-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, the Principal Scottiſh Agents, there were divers other inferior Emiſſaries of that Nation, who went to and fro to carry on the Traiterous Intercourſe between <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and with the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi> Such as <hi>William Carſtares,</hi> a Scotch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle-Preacher to a Numerous Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37494:29"/>at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> where <hi>Rumbald</hi> was his frequent Hearer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Spence,</hi> who had been Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptroler, and was now Employed as Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary to the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> taken in <hi>London</hi> under the Name of <hi>Butler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Nisbet,</hi> born in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> bred up at the Univerſity of <hi>Edenburgh;</hi> where he was the Leader of thoſe Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Students, who rais'd a Tumult upon occaſion of Burning the Pope in that City.</p>
            <p>But of all the Conſpirators, whether Engliſh, or Scotch, the Man, to whom next the late Earls of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and <hi>Argyle,</hi> belong'd the chief place and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence in the whole Diabolical Deſign, was <hi>Robert Ferguſon</hi> a Scotch-Man; he had been divers Years a fierce Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent-Preacher in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and had long Brandiſh'd his Poys'nous Tongue and Virulent Pen againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: He is manifeſtly convicted to have had a Hand in the moſt Scandalous Libels of thoſe Times; And was always parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly cheriſhed, magnified and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Party, for his peculiar Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in aſperſing the Government, and reviling His Majeſties Perſon. So that upon all Accounts, of his reſtleſs Spirit,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37494:30"/>fluent Tongue, ſubtil Brain, and helliſh Malice, he was perfectly qualifi'd to be the great Incendiary, and common Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator of the whole Conſpiracy; and after <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Death, it cannot be denied, but he was the Life , and Soul of all, eſpecially for the carrying on of the Aſſaſſination.</p>
            <p>Theſe Perſons appear hitherto to have been the principal Contrivers or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the whole Treaſon in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Divers others there are, concerning whom more than conjectural Proofs may be given, of their being engaged in it: But His Majeſty is willing to ſpare par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Names, as far as may ſtand with the Neceſſary, and Juſt Vindication of his Government.</p>
            <p>It may ſuffice, that of theſe His Majeſty has here allowed to be mention'd, the World is abundantly ſatisfied, that the ſeveral Shares they undertook in this Conſpiracy, were very agreeable to their former well known perverſe Principles, and declared Diſaffections to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>It is therefore certain that in the Year 1682, before, and eſpecially after <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer-Day,</hi> when the great Buſineſs of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37494:30"/>Electing the City Sheriffs came of courſe to be Agitated; the whole Factious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in and about the Town, prepared to employ the Main of their Power and Craft in preventing the Swearing of the True Sheriffs , on the <hi>Michaelmas-Day</hi> enſuing.</p>
            <p>All which time nothing was omitted by the Diſloyal Citizens, and great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Strangers unduly mingled with them in all their Aſſemblies, to elude or terrifie the Honeſt Zeal of the Loyal, and to deceive and gain over the doubtful Members of the City; Whether by direct or indirect ways, it matter'd not: For juſt about that time the New and Deviliſh Invention came to be moſt in Vogue, by which they made the receiving all Oaths, and taking the very Bleſſed Sacrament of the Lords Supper, to be only an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the promoting their pretended Godly Deſigns.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in that ſpace of time, all imaginable prophane, and ſeemingly holy Cheats and Prevarications were Practis'd: All ſorts of Arms never before known to be procured in ſuch Quantities by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons; ſuch as Blunderbuſſes, Steel Armor cover'd with Silk, and the like, were carefully ſought after, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37494:31"/>bought up: The moſt improbable falſe Rumors fill'd every Street; That now all true Proteſtants were to be Maſſacred in an Inſtant; That ſuch Sheriffs were Nominated, as had contented to be the Executioners; That Popery was ſpeedily to be Introduced barefac'd, and in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; That all faithful Adherents to the Government were but Papiſts in Maſcarade: Popery being ſtill made the Word of Alarm to excite and exaſperate the Populace: Though it is manifeſt, the Authors of all thoſe Clamours againſt Popery, never intended its Suppreſſion: For that would not have conſiſted with their Deſign, which was, by the Popular Dread of it, upon all Occaſions to ſhake the Crown, and undermine the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Truth is, to ſuch a heighth of Arrogance were things grown on their ſide, that whoever ſhall indifferently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the dangerous Devices, ſlanderous Reports and Writings, and other violent Emotions of the whole Party, that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in the City, they will have juſt cauſe to conclude, that the courſe of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings was not ſo much a Civil Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle againſt their Fellow-Citizens for Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory in the Peaceable Choice of Two
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37494:31"/>ſubordinate Officers of juſtice, as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive Contention for a Maſtery over the whole Government.</p>
            <p>Yet however cunningly the Train was laid, it took no effect but on themſelves. The Noiſe and Rage of all their Mutinous Routs in Taverns and Coffee-Houſes vaniſh'd into Air. Sir <hi>John Moor</hi> the Lord Mayor, together with the greater number of wiſer, richer, and better Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, underſtood rightly, and ſtuck un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably to the Kingdoms, and their own true Intereſt. Mr. <hi>North</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> were quietly admitted, and ſworn Sheriffs at the appointed time, with the uſual Solemnities.</p>
            <p>Immediately after this, the very ſame Night the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> privately withdrew from his own Houſe, redoubling his old Exclamations of Popery, Tyranny, Superſtition, Idolatry, Oppreſſions, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Iriſh Witneſſes; of whoſe Suborna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no Man in the three Kingdoms could have given a more exact account than himſelf.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he thus lay ſecret in the City, <hi>Romzey, Walcot, Ferguſon, Goodenough,</hi> and others his Complices, daily frequenting him, they applied themſelves with all diligence to expedite the Rebellious Work
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37494:32"/>before projected: His Vain-glory, and the Conceit of his own Dexterity, and his former conſtant ſucceſs in making Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, inclining him to fancy what his Flatterers ſuggeſted, that the whole City and Kingdom were at his beck, and upon the holding up of his Finger, would preſently riſe in Arms to extirpate the two Brothers, Slavery and Popery, as they were lewdly wont, in their private Debauches, to ſtyle the King and his Royal Righneſs.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had ſome time before let on foot a Treaty with the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> who, after his eſcape out of <hi>Edenburgh</hi>-Caſtle, came privily to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> held divers Meetings with the Confederates, and offer'd, that for 30000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling he would make a ſturdy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion in <hi>Scotland.</hi> But the Sum of Money demanded being ſo conſiderable, and many other Scruples ſtarted, and unforeſeen Difficulties riſing, which could not ſo preſently be removed , as <hi>Argyle</hi>'s preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing danger required, he firſt quitted the Field, and retired into <hi>Holland,</hi> with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there at a greater diſtance, and more ſecurity, to renew and proſecute the ſame Propoſal.</p>
            <p>About that time alſo both ways of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37494:32"/>theſe Kingdoms were brought under their Conſideration, the general way of an Inſurrection, and the more compendious way , as they call'd it, of Aſſaſſinating the King and Duke in their return that <hi>October</hi> from <hi>Newmarket.</hi> The Inſurrection was inſtantly promoted on all Hands, in Town and Country. But the Aſſaſſination having then not been ſoon enough thought on, went no farther than Diſcourſe, to be afterwards reſumed, and more deliberately provided for againſt the next Opportunity.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the long expected <hi>Michaelmas-Day</hi> being thus calmly paſs'd, and the New Sheriffs having taken a peaceable Poſſeſſion of that Power, whoſe influence on the whole Nation, the ſaid Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> well underſtood, no Man better: Then he began on a ſudden to have a quicker and ſharper ſenſe of the urgent State of their common Affairs, eſpecially of his own Imminent Peril, and to accuſe the reſt of the Confederates of backwardneſs, if not of Treachery in the Publick Cauſe: Firſt communicating his Suſpicions and Jealouſies to the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> who had been ſo lately the Companion of his reſtraint, and Gaol-Delivery.</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:37494:33"/>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was retir'd ſome Days before into Eſſex, waiting the reſult of that great Day in the City, whence he receiv'd frequent intimations from his Friends of the Faction, in a Style obſcure, but by him well underſtood and concerted between them; That now the buſineſs which had been Tranſacting ſo long amongſt his Correſpondents, was coming to good Iſſue, and call'd for his ſpeedy preſence.</p>
            <p>That occaſioned his return on the ſame <hi>Michaelmas-Day,</hi> and preſently after, <hi>Walcot</hi> came to him from the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> with a Meſſage expreſſing his earneſt deſire to ſpeak with him, in his Concealment at one <hi>Watſon</hi>'s in <hi>Wood-ſtreet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> giving him a Viſit, the ſubſtance of the ſaid Earl's firſt diſcourſe with him, was, That finding the Due Elections , as lie call'd them, of the City fruſtrated , and the Pſeudo-Sheriffs eſtabliſh'd, he could no longer think any honeſt Man ſafe; and had therefore hid himſelf there, having firſt made what Preparations were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for a ſudden Riſing: That many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands were ready in the City to Maſter the Gates, and attack <hi>Whitehal:</hi> That
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:37494:33"/>they within were to be aſſiſted from the Countries adjacent with 1000 or 1200 Horſe under good Officers. Only he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s, and the other great Mens backwardneſs, who had promiſed, by Riſing in other remote Counties at the ſame time, to give a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to the ſtanding Forces.</p>
            <p>The Sum of this the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> the next day Communicated to the ſaid Duke; who alſo on his part complain'd of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s acting of late on a ſeparate Bottom, and that his preſent Fears had blinded his uſual Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and therefore he required a ſpeedy Meeting with him, to re-eſtabliſh a better Underſtanding and Union of Counſels between them all for the future.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe being reported back to the ſaid Earl, he replied, <hi>His People were impatient of longer delays, having advanc'd ſo far, that there was no retreat; the Deſign being imparted to ſo many, that it was impoſſible but it would quickly take Air.</hi> Upon this he proceeded to declare his vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuſpicion of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth; That his Dilatorineſs proceeded from ſome private Correſpondence between him and his Majeſty: That it was to be fear'd the ſaid Duke acted with a proſpect very different
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:37494:34"/>from theirs; only minding the advancement of himſtelf: whereas his own Reſolutions were, that ſince it was now manifeſt their Liberties were no more to be ſecur'd but under a Commonwealth, he alone with his Intereſt would attempt the Deliverance of his Country: If the reſt of the Lords would concur with him, they might ſhare in the Glory; elſe he hoped he ſhould be able to effect the Work without them , by the help of an honeſt brisk Party in the City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Anſwer the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> ſuſpecting that before their People could be ready in the Country, the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s unſeaſonable Anxiety for his own Safety might put him on attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome raſh Action in <hi>London,</hi> which would be eaſily quell'd by the form'd and diſciplin'd Guards, and ſo the whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign might be ſtifled in a moment; he did therefore the more earneſtly preſs the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> to make another eſſay to procure an Interview.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Howard</hi> did ſo, and got from the ſaid Earl a promiſe of meeting the Confederate Lords the next Day in the Evening; which yet, when the time came, he put off with an excuſe by Colonel <hi>Romzey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, ſome Days after they did
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:37494:34"/>meet; their Differences were in ſome meaſure piec'd up, and they began to act joyntly again towards a ſpeedy Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe ſeveral Days were propoſed. One about the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> but it was delay'd a little longer, till the concurrence of the ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties could be ſignified up: Then that of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> being <hi>Novemb.</hi> 17. was named, but rejected, becauſe all His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Guards were commonly in Arms to watch and ſuppreſs the wonted Tumults of the Rabble on that Day.</p>
            <p>At laſt the Nineteenth of <hi>November</hi> was fixt on; which happening that Year to be on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> whilſt ſome excepted againſt it for that reaſon, <hi>Ferguſon</hi> with his uſual impious Virulency, reply'd, <hi>That the Sanctity of the Day was ſuitable to the Sanctity of the Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Day being thus determin'd, they all preſently fell to prepare as their ſeveral parts were allotted: Eſpecially the great Managers held Aſſemblies to receive Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, how the Counties were diſpos'd, and to conſult upon ſurprizing the Guards; for which end the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Armſtrong,</hi> undertook to view the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:37494:35"/>poſture of their Quarters, and reported back to their Principals, <hi>That the ſeizing them was a thing very feaſible;</hi> which very particular the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confeſs'd in ſo many words to His Majeſty, when he rendred himſelf.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Earl of <hi>Shaftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> was very uneaſie, and weary of lurking in Holes, where every ſound and breath of Air began to frighten him. Wherefore with repeated and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Meſſages he preſs'd the other Lords to keep to their Day; expoſtulating with them upon their former ſlowneſs, whereby they had loſt ſo many advantageous Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities. The caſe being now ſo much alter'd, that he, who once preſum'd his dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out the King would prove but a lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely walk to him; when the danger drew near himſelf, was become ſo apprehenſive, and raſh, as not to afford his own wicked Counſels leiſure enough to come to any tolerable Maturity.</p>
            <p>At length one Day, when their great Council about <hi>London</hi> was aſſembled at <hi>Shepard</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Abchurch-Lane,</hi> the ſaid Earl ſent Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> to quicken their Debates , and once for all to learn the reſult of their final Determinations. But they having juſt before received ſeveral
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37494:35"/>Advices out of the Weſt, that their Friends there, eſpecially in <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> could not poſſibly be ready on ſo ſhort a warning, preſently ſent him back ſuch word; concluding it could not be helpt, but he and they muſt be content to reſpite the time of Execution to a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger day.</p>
            <p>This poſitive Anſwer broke all his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and made him inſtantly reſolve to leave <hi>England.</hi> Wherefore firſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved his lodging into <hi>Wapping;</hi> Then, the very Night that place was Burnt, being alſo the Night of the ſame 19th Day of <hi>November</hi> on which he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to ſet the whole Nation in a Flame, he privately ſculk'd down the River; Attended only by the two chief Complices and Witneſſes of his Treaſons, <hi>Walcot</hi> and <hi>Ferguſon;</hi> the latter of them having been forc'd for ſome time before to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcond too, becauſe of a Warrant out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, for Publiſhing ſome one, or other of his many Treaſonable Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets.</p>
            <p>That was the laſt conſiderable Effort made by the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> againſt the King and Kingdom. After this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more was heard of him, but that being got into <hi>Holland</hi> in a Panick fright,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:37494:36"/>he lived obſcurely and ſoon after died in <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> having few or no other Companions of the laſt part of his Life, but ſeveral miſerable Engliſh and Scotch Fugitives, who had formerly been the Inſtruments of his Trayterous Practiſes, and were forc'd to fly the ſtroke of Juſtice, on that Account: So that he could not but know, that all thoſe about him in his Sickneſs and Death, had Juſt reaſon to hate, and curſe him, as their principal Seducer and cauſe of their Ruine.</p>
            <p>Nor can ſuch an end of ſuch a Life be juſtly reflected on, without a ſpecial Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſecret Counſels of the Divine Providence. That he, who a little before was generally eſteem'd the Head , and Protector of all the Factious in the Kingdom, whom he vouchſafed to diſtinguiſh and Honour by the Title of Worthy Men , and the Terror and Scourges of all the Good, and the Loyal, whom he mark'd out, and deſign'd for Deſtruction and Slaughter, under the Name of Men Worthy: He who, in his own conceit, had ſo much the abſolute diſpoſal of the Hearts and Hands of all the Diſaffected, as to be able to ſubvert the Eſtabliſh'd Government, when he pleaſed, and had really once gone very far to effect;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37494:36"/>it, had not his own Preſumption Defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Malice; That this very Man, having ſeen all his hopes , and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances daſh'd in Pieces at home, ſhould have nothing left to do, but to take ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in that Commonwealth, which in his former Greatneſs, he had ſo mortally provok'd; there to lead a Life of Diſgrace and Miſery, and to Dye neglected in a Country of which he had formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd ſo great a Hatred: And yet ſtill retaining ſo much Venemous Rancour againſt his moſt Gracious Maſter, as to profeſs with his laſt Breath, that he had deſervedly receiv'd his Deaths Wound, meaning the bruiſe in his Side and now his Death in that Country, where he had done his own ſo much Miſchief; When he was one of the Commiſſioners ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the Year 1660, to invite His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty home freely and without Terms.</p>
            <p>After this, though the Earl of <hi>Shaftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> was gone, yet the impreſſions of Miſchief he had left behind on the minds of the Confederates, would not ſo eaſily vaniſh. They ſoon reflected on his laſt advice, that ſo many having been made Conſcious to the Deſign, they ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find more ſafety in puſhing it on boldly, than in too late a Retreat. Upon
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37494:37"/>this immediately they recover'd their Spirits and Reſolution, which his haſty flight had ſomewhat Damp'd; thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth they renewed their Conſultations with greater vigour than before: The Principal Managers having their frequent Meetings, as alſo the inferior Inſtruments theirs; whilſt ſome of each Number gave ſecret intimations to the other of what was paſſing in their ſeparate Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>Of the great Council of Six, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults that have been hitherto plainly teſtifi'd and ſworn to, were thoſe at Mr. <hi>Hambdens,</hi> at the Lord <hi>Ruſſels,</hi> and at Mr. <hi>Shepards.</hi> The Subordinate Cabals were kept in divers places in and about the City; As in the <hi>December</hi> of that Year, at Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi>'s Houſe in the <hi>Soho</hi> Square; in the next <hi>February</hi> at <hi>Weſt</hi>'s Chamber in the Temple, about which time it was agreed that <hi>Ferguſon</hi> ſhould be ſent for, as he was, and came over ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Then their Meetings were more frequent upon the Kings being at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and after: Uſually at <hi>Weſt</hi>'s Lodging, for the conveniency of its ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; Or in common Taverns; As at the <hi>Miter</hi> within <hi>Aldgate;</hi> The <hi>Horſe-Shooe</hi> on <hi>Tower-Hill;</hi> The <hi>Fortune</hi> at <hi>Wapping;</hi> The <hi>Syracuſa-Houſe;</hi> The <hi>Kings-head</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:37494:37"/>in <hi>Atheiſt-Alley;</hi> The <hi>Salutation</hi> and the <hi>George</hi> in <hi>Lumbard-Street</hi> on <hi>June</hi> the Twelfth, the very Day of the Diſcovery, they met at the <hi>Sun-Tavern</hi> behind the <hi>Exchange;</hi> on <hi>June</hi> 14 they met at <hi>Bailly</hi> of <hi>Jerviſwood</hi>'s Chamber, and again in <hi>Bartholomew-Lane,</hi> and at the <hi>Green-Dragon</hi> on <hi>Snow-hill;</hi> and ſo continued to do ſome where or other, till they totally diſpers'd from <hi>Walcot</hi>'s Lodging in <hi>Goodman</hi>'s <hi>Fields.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Meetings being ſo generally in places of Publick Entertainment; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent the Obſervation of Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Servants, they often diſcours'd of their whole Bloody Buſineſs, in a Canting Language of their own making.</p>
            <p>The King was ſometimes call'd the <hi>Church-Warden</hi> of <hi>Whitehall:</hi> The King and Duke the <hi>Black-Bird</hi> and the <hi>Gold-Finch;</hi> the <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of Arms, as <hi>Blunderbuſſes, Muskets, Piſtols,</hi> were talk'd of, under the diſguis'd Names of <hi>Swan-Quills, Gooſe-Quills, Crow-Quills.</hi> The Inſurrection was ſtyled the <hi>General Point,</hi> the Aſſaſſination the <hi>Lopping Point,</hi> and ſtriking at the Head. And becauſe ſeveral of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators were Lawyers, it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times agreed, that their wicked inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37494:38"/>againſt the King and the Duke, ſhould be veil'd under the terms of Diſſeſing him in Poſſeſſion, and barring him in Remainder: At other times the Killing of both paſs'd for executing a Bargain and Sale, as being a ſhort man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Conveyance; and the Riſing in Arms, as the longer, and more tedious way, for executing a Leaſe and Releaſe. The Villains thus wantonly abuſing the Innocent Terms of the excellent Profeſſion of the common Laws of <hi>England,</hi> to cover their horrid Deſigns againſt His Majeſties Perſon and Crown, whoſe Preſervation and Proſperity is the great end, and ſenſe of all thoſe Laws.</p>
            <p>But for the moſt part, when they were free and amongſt themſelves, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd of the whole contrivance in plain Language, and without reſerve: their common Healths being ſuch as theſe; <hi>To the Man who firſt draws his Sword againſt Popery and Slavery, in defence of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion. Confuſion to the two Brothers, Popery and Slavery;</hi> explaining the ſame to be meant of the Royal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of <hi>Whitehal</hi> And when ſome of them, who were leſs harden'd in Cruelty, expreſs'd ſome kind of conſternation and dread of the Conſequences of ſo dire a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:37494:38"/>Stroak, and deſir'd the Infamy of it might be thrown on the Papiſts; others, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> declared, <hi>They thought the Action too good to have the Papiſts carry away the Honour of it;</hi> and often applauded it as a <hi>Glorious Work; That it would he an Admonition to all Princes to take heed how they Oppreſſed their Subjects; That he hoped to ſee the Fact rewarded by a Parliament, and the Actors in it have the Honour of Statues erected to them, and the Title of Preſervers of their Country.</hi> So alſo when <hi>Nelthrop, Walcot</hi> and ſome few others readily declar'd themſelves willing to joyn in the Inſurrection, but ſhrunk a little at firſt at the horrour of the Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>R. Rumbald</hi> and <hi>R. Goodenough</hi> with monſtrous impiety maintain'd the Kings and the Dukes Murder as the more pious Deſign of the two, and recommended it as keeping one of the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the beſt way to prevent ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Chriſtian Blood.</p>
            <p>In theſe their private Cabals, the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they promiſcuouſly treated of, were either a general Inſurrection, or the Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſination of the Kings and his Royal Highneſſes Perſons. Of the Aſſaſſination divers ways were conſulted, till they fix'd on that of the <hi>Rye.</hi> The Inſurrection
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:37494:39"/>was propoſed to be made at the ſame time in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> The adjuſting that part of it, which related to <hi>Scotland,</hi> was chiefly under the care of the Council of Six, and manag'd by Commiſſioners of both Nations ſitting in <hi>London:</hi> All which Particulars are ſo circumſtantially ſet forth, ſo often repeated, and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly confirm'd in the enſuing Evidences, that it will be ſufficient here only to direct the Readers Obſervation, by giving a brief Summary of the whole.</p>
            <p>Towards an Inſurrection throughout <hi>England,</hi> they laid the greateſt ſtreſs on the City of <hi>London;</hi> not doubting but if that were once ſecur'd to them, the reſt of the Nation muſt of courſe fall in; taking incouragement and example in this, as in many other things, from the curſed Methods of the Unnatural Rebellion in the late Kings time.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>London</hi> therefore was carefully divided by them into Twenty parts; and to that purpoſe one of the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Maps of the City and Liberties was hung up in <hi>Weſt</hi>'s Chamber, the moſt uſual place of their Rendezvouzes; the making the ſeveral Partitions and Allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the whole, being committed to <hi>Richard Goodenough,</hi> who by reaſon of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37494:39"/>his univerſal acquaintance, as having been ſo often Under-Sheriff, was judg'd the fitteſt Man of the whole Party for that Work.</p>
            <p>The City being thus divided, it was agreed, that every Diviſion ſhould be aſſign'd to ſome one Principal Man of geateſt Truſt, Courage and Conduct; each of thoſe Twenty was to chuſe Nine or Ten, or more, in whom they could conſide. Theſe were to have the inſpection of the ſeveral Under-walks, and from time to time to make returns of their Numbers and Strength; and when the Liſt was finiſh'd, it was to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the ſupreme Managers.</p>
            <p>By this means they made no queſtion but they ſhould have a ſelect Body of at leaſt Eight or Ten Thouſand approved and well appointed Men to make the firſt Onſet; <hi>Goodenough</hi> alone having aſſur'd them, that out of ſeven Diviſions only, there were 3000 Reſolute Men prepar'd to be ready at an hours warning.</p>
            <p>For the increaſing their Numbers, and drawing in new Converts , this one general Rule was carefully preſcribed, That the bottom of the Deſign ſhould in the beginning be warily conceal'd from all Perſons with whom they treated.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37494:40"/>Firſt their Inclinations were to be try'd by gradual Inſinuations, and plauſible Diſcourſes at a diſtance, till they had gain'd a full aſſurance of their Fidelity. They were to be ask'd, <hi>What they would, or could do, in caſe of a Foreign Invaſion?</hi> When it was anſwer'd, <hi>They would readily aſſiſt againſt any Common Enemy:</hi> Then it was next to be demanded, <hi>Whether they would contribute the aſſiſtance of their Perſons, or Purſes, or both?</hi> That being alſo deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, it was to be farther inquired, <hi>What Furniture of Arms, Horſes, and Money they had in readineſs? What Friends they could Engage?</hi> And if theſe Queſtions were reſolved according to their Minds, then the whole Myſtery of the Villany was to be frankly diſcloſed. They were to be told in down-right terms, That there was already an Oppreſſion and Force upon all they had; That there was an actual Invaſion on the Engliſh Liberties, Properties and Conſciences: That the only Obligation the Subject has to the King, is a Mutual Covenant; That this Covenant was manifeſtly broken on the Kings part; That therefore the People were free from all Oaths, or other tyes of Fealty and Allegiance, and had the Natural Liberty reſtored to them of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37494:40"/>aſſerting their own Rights, and as juſtly at leaſt againſt a Domeſtick, as againſt Foreign Invaders.</p>
            <p>The way being thus made to ſound and prepare the Diſpoſitions of ill Men for any Violent Enterprize; the next thing that came under Deliberation was Mony. For that, ſeveral of the particular Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators declared, they had conſiderable Sums of their own, or depoſited with them, which were ready, and might be call'd for on Occaſion; That great Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions had been made of divers Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Pounds, which when the time of Action drew neer, were to be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted amongſt the Chief of the Twenty Diviſions; That this would be enough to make proviſion for a ſudden Puſh: But if the buſineſs ſucceeded, Half a Years Rent of the <hi>Chimney-Mony</hi> would be due, beſides what the <hi>Exciſe-Office</hi> and the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> might afford: That all the Mony and Plate in <hi>Lumbard-ſtreet,</hi> and what was in the poſſeſſion of the Bankers Goldſmiths, and other Wealthy Men in <hi>London,</hi> or the Suburbs, was either to be ſeiz'd on as a juſt Forfeiture, or Borrowed under the Name of the Old, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated Cheat of the Publick Faith. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> whoſe conſtant Cuſtom
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:37494:41"/>it was, in all their Conſults, to out-do all the reſt by ſome peculiar Circumſtance of Cruelty of his own Invention, added on this Head, That <hi>little or nothing was to be expected from the Old Rich Citizens; that therefore Five or Six of them were to be kill'd at firſt, and their Eſtates given to the Mobile, to terrifie the reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next neceſſary Proviſion they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated on was Arms. And it is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly known, the whole Party had for a long time before, been gathering great abundance of all Sorts: All probably with the ſame proſpect, and in the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion for their Parts in the Conſpiracy, as the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> had done for his, though they happen'd not all to be ſo manifeſtly detected. For a good while before any Conſpiracy was ſuſpected by His Majeſty, or his Miniſters, the ſaid Lord was found to have by him, hid under other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Furniture in a dark Garret, above Fourſcore Compleat Arms in his Private City-Houſe, where no open Robbery or Aſſault could be fear'd; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, there could not be the leaſt ſhadow of pretence that they were laid in there for his own lawful uſe or defence.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe Stores, which they had every one made for themſelves; it was
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37494:41"/>reſolv'd at the very firſt to attempt the Publick Magazines in and about the City; Particularly that in the <hi>Artillery-Ground,</hi> where a conſiderable Number of Excellent Arms were commonly kept without a Guards, for the frequent exerciſes of the Citizens.</p>
            <p>Many thoughts alſo were ſpent how to engage the Seamen to their Side. To this end ſeveral Riotous Meetings were made at <hi>Wapping,</hi> the greateſt Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them not diſdaining there to Feaſt and Cajole the Rabble; often ſtyling that Scum of People they there met with, their honeſt <hi>Wrapping</hi> Friends. Beſides this, ſome Sea Captains were tamper'd with, and a Golden Ball was propoſed to be hurl'd upon <hi>Black-Heath;</hi> none queſtioning but the Seamen, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at that ſport, would declare for them as one Man; upon a groundleſs fancy, that they were of themſelves highly diſcontented, and ready to Mutiny for want of Pay.</p>
            <p>Though it muſt be ſaid, and His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty does hereby publickly own, that their Practiſes with the Seamen met with the leaſt ſucceſs of any. Nor is it ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, the brave Race of Engliſh Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhould ever prove falſe to His Majeſty,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37494:42"/>who has cheriſh'd, incourag'd, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted that Profeſſion more than all the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have done ſince the Conqueſt; His Majeſty well underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Safety, Riches and Honour of this Kingdom depend moſt on its Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Greatneſs.</p>
            <p>However, the Conſpirators not in the leaſt doubting but they ſhould have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Numbers to make a ſtand, and give time to others to come in, and declare; their Rendezvouſes were appointed in the chief Piazza's, and moſt or the convenient Poſts of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> whence they might at once Attack the <hi>Bridge,</hi> the <hi>Exchanges,</hi> the Guards, the <hi>Savoy, Whitehal</hi> and the <hi>Tower;</hi> and they had ready in Town about 100 of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s old Officers to Head and Govern the mixt Multitude as ſoon as they ſhould appear in Arms.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time a Party of 500 Horſe was to come out of the Country to ſcour the Streets; and immediately Barricadoes were to be made: the Horſes of Hackney-Coaches, and other Strangers were to be ſeiz'd on: the Horſe-Guards not actually mounted to be ſurpriz'd in their ſeveral Stables: the Churches to be broken open, and uſed as St. <hi>Pauls</hi> was in the late times.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:37494:42"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferguſon</hi> had alſo often aſſur'd them, he could promiſe for three hundred Scots to be ready at a day; affirming, that ſuch a Number, moſt of them <hi>Bothwel-Bridge</hi> Men, reſided about Town, as Journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in divers Trades, and were to be commanded by Ten or Twelve Gentlemen of that Nation: Adding, that ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds more went about the Country with Packs, taking that way to get and carry Intelligence, as well as for a Livelyhood.</p>
            <p>Upon ſuppoſition of this Strength, <hi>Whitehal</hi> was to be aſſaulted at once by one Party from the <hi>Strand,</hi> by another on the back-ſide from <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and on the River by Water-Men in Boats with Hand-Granadoes. And in confidence that His Majeſty and the whole Court would ſpeedily either be taken or fly, there were diſtinct Parties aſſign'd to way-lay them on the Road either to <hi>Windſor</hi> or <hi>Portſmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their principal Aim being to ſurprize the <hi>Tower,</hi> as a place moſt able to annoy them, and where there lay great Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines and Stores of Ammunition to furniſh them, they had many Debates of Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems propoſed on that ſubject.</p>
            <p>One was to be perform'd by Night, by firing a parcel of Fagots to burn down
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:37494:43"/>the Gates, whilſt a ſtrong Party without was to be ready to make a brisk Attack in the firſt Confuſion of the Gariſon.</p>
            <p>Another to be Executed about Two in the Afternoon, thus; One party privately Arm'd was to go ſee the Armory, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other the Lions: The firſt to return into the Sutler's Houſe by the Gate: At the ſame time, ſome were to come in Coaches on pretence of viſiting the Lords then Priſoners: Thoſe in the Sutler's Houſe were to Iſſue out, and kill a Horſe, or overthrow a Coach juſt in the paſſage. Then both parties to joyn, and ſeize on the Guards; and by a ſign given, upon the Coaches over-turning, Two or Three Hundred Men, lodg'd in Houſes thereby, were to come in and Second the reſt.</p>
            <p>Another was, that ſome of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, as Conſtables, and Officers, of Juſtice, ſhould bring in others as Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and that ſeveral ſhould enter feined Actions one againſt the other in St. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharines-Court,</hi> then held in the <hi>Tower:</hi> On the Court Day others were to come in as Plaintiffs, Defendents, and Witneſſes, who joyning with thoſe that ſeem'd to come out of Curioſity, all theſe might be ſeconded by a like party prepar'd from without; the over turning a Coach being
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:37494:43"/>likewiſe made uſe of in this Caſe Which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of theſe ways ſhould happen to be attempted: The Lord <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-General of the Ordnance was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to be diſpatch'd, as one whoſe Bravery and Courage they fear'd would prompt him to Blow up the Great Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine of Powder there, and ſo Bury them with himſelf in the Ruine, if he found he could not other ways reſiſt them.</p>

               </gap> means the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> which was their greateſt Care; they had alſo under Conſideration the Raiſing Commotions at the ſame time in divers other parts of <hi>England:</hi> Eſpecially in thoſe Counties of the <hi>Weſt</hi> and <hi>North,</hi> which they believed the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>'s Progreſſes had moſt inclined to their Factious Intereſt.</p>
            <p>In every County ſome one Great Man was to put himſelf at the Head of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and divers of them had their proper Stations appointed.</p>
            <p>Particularly of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> they made themſelves ſure; and laid great ſtreſs upon it, by reaſon of its vicinity to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the influence its Coal-Pits have on the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Cheſhire</hi> they depended on a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:37494:44"/>aſſiſtance; that being the County, in which the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly adviſed the Inſurrection ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and a Free Parliament be declar'd for, at the time of the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>'s going thither in one of his Mock-Triumphs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Portſmouth</hi> was to be attempted by ſome going into the Town on pretence of ſeeing the place; at the ſame time ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party coming in on the Market-day, diſguis'd like Country-Men, and both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether were to fall on the Guards.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Taunton</hi> they expected great Numbers, remembring the old Diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Inhabitants, which they had evidenc'd by a moſt remarkable inſolence; having preſumed for ſome Years after His Majeſties moſt happy Reſtoration, to keep ſolemnly a Day or Thankſgiving to God for raiſing the Siege which his Father had laid againſt the Parliaments Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Forces in that Town.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Briſtol</hi> they had ſecured a good Party, which they doubted not might eaſily Maſter the City; as manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the full Confeſſion of <hi>Holloway</hi> Citizen of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which he freely made upon his very firſt Examination, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards confirm'd at his Execution,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:37494:44"/>when he could not have the leaſt hope of Pardon to be obtain'd thereby.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time when they were making theſe Preparations for an Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, the other deſign of Aſſaſſinating His Majesty and his Royal Highness kept equal pace with it.</p>
            <p>It is manifeſt that ſome of theſe very Men had often before deviſed the Kings and his Royal Brothers Murder divers ways. For beſides what <hi>Hone</hi> confeſs'd of the Propoſal to ſhoot them from <hi>Bow-Steeple;</hi> and another Project of deſtroying them the next Lord Mayor's Day before, which was laid aſide upon notice that His Majeſty and his Brother intended not to be there; and beſides <hi>Richard Rumbald</hi>'s Invention of blowing up the Play-houſe, when they ſhould both be preſent; the ſaid <hi>Rumbald</hi> informed his Confederates, that he and ſome of his Friends had reſolv'd to cut off the King and the Duke in their Journey to, or from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> above ten Years before; and had lain ſometime in ambuſh to that purpoſe, but without effect, becauſe, as God would have it, His Majeſty and his Royal Brother then unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly went the other way through the Foreſt; which, as the Wretch himſelf could not but obſerve, they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37494:45"/>have ſeldom or never done before or ſince.</p>
            <p>And now alſo, upon this occaſion, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ways of performing the Aſſaſſination were debated. One was to make the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt on them in St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Park,</hi> as they were paſſing privately, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times almoſt alone to st. <hi>James</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>Another, when they ſhould be going down the River for their Divertiſement, either to ſink the Barge by over-running it with an Hoy, or by boarding it on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and Shooting out ſome Planks with Blunderbuſſes.</p>
            <p>Another, to plant Men in the Pit at the <hi>Play-Houſe,</hi> who ſhould be ready to Shoot at them unawares with Pocket Blunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſſes, two of which <hi>Rumzey</hi> ſent to His Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Another, to do it in their return thence to <hi>Whitehal,</hi> under <hi>Bedford-Wall</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden;</hi> where one part of the Aſſaſſines might walk unſuſpected in the Piazza, a Second within the Rails, a Third in the Church-Porch; and all Iſſue forth in an Inſtant, to compaſs the Coaches, and diſpatch the Buſineſs, or do the Trick, as they ſtyl'd it.</p>
            <p>It was alſo propoſed to be undertaken between <hi>Windſor</hi> and <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> or
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:37494:45"/>in their going to <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> or if the Royal Brothers ſhould happen to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Bull-Feaſt in <hi>Red-Lyon-Fields.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all theſe other propoſitions, as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to far more Caſualties and Hazards, ſoon gave place to that of the <hi>Rye</hi> in <hi>Hartfordſhire:</hi> A Houſe then inhabited by the forefaid <hi>Richard Rumbald;</hi> who propoſed that to be the Seat of the Action, offering himſelf to Command the Party, that was to do be Work. Him therefore, as their moſt darning Captain, and by reaſon of a Blemiſh in one of his Eyes, they were afterwards wont, in Common Diſcourſe, to call <hi>Hannibal:</hi> Often Drinking Healths to <hi>Hannibal and his Boys;</hi> meaning <hi>Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald</hi> and his Helliſh Crew.</p>
            <p>The commodiouſneſs of the <hi>Rye</hi> for any ſuch deſperate Enterprize ſoon incourag'd them to ſix it there: Its lonely and retir'd Situation, and the Incloſures about it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as would afford all advantages imaginable to the Aſſailants, and give as great Inconveniences to the Perſons attacked.</p>
            <p>The place being agreed on, it was firſt queſtion'd, whether the ſtroke ſhould be ſtruck, upon His Majeſties going to, or coming from <hi>Newmarket:</hi> But it was
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:37494:46"/>thought more expedient to defer it till His Majeſties return.</p>
            <p>That Point being over, they had ſeveral Meetings, to conſult of all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Parricide.</p>
            <p>The Number of the Men to be perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally engaged were Forty at Leaſt, to that end two or three Liſts of Names were drawn up, out of which the choice was to be made, and the Roll was neer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted.</p>
            <p>The Arms to be uſed were Blunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſſes, Muskets, Piſtols, Carabines. To get them down thither without ſuſpicion, many ways were thought on. One, to put them up in Cheſts, and bring them by Land in Carts. Another, to hide them in a Boat, under Coals, or Oyſters, or ſuch common Lading, and ſo to convey them up the River of <hi>Ware.</hi> Another, that every one concern'd ſhould go down pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily Arm'd, and ſo all Travelling in ſmall Parties, ſcatter'd, and at their leiſure, they might eaſily meet unperceived about the <hi>Rye;</hi> at the time prefixt.</p>
            <p>When the Fatal Hour ſhould approach, the attempt was agreed to be made in this manner: Some one or two were to be ſent forth on the Road towards <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market,</hi> to diſcover in which Coach the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:37494:46"/>King came, and what Company attended him; which they well knew was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly no more than ſome ſix of the Guards; and thoſe alſo were ſuppoſed to have their Horſes weak, and almoſt tired by that time they came thither, ſo near <hi>Hodſdon?</hi> one of the uſual Stages where His Majeſty was wont to change Coaches and Guards.</p>
            <p>Upon warning thus given of the Kings being near at hand, all were to be in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs within the Houſe and Yards to iſſue forth in a moment, ſome on Horſeback, ſome on Foot.</p>
            <p>Immediately upon the Coaches coming within the Gates and Hedges about the Houſe, the Conſpirators were to divide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral Parties: Some before in the habit of Labourers were to overthrow a Cart in the narroweſt paſſage, ſo to prevent all poſſibility of eſcape: Others were to fight the Guards, <hi>Walcot</hi> chuſing that part upon a Punctilio of Honour: Others were to ſhoot at the Coach-man, Poſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and Horſes: Others to aim only at His Majeſties Coach, which Party was to be under the particular direction of <hi>Rumbald</hi> himſelf; the Villain declaring before-hand, That upon that occaſion he would make uſe of a very good Blunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſs,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37494:47"/>which was in <hi>Weſt</hi>'s poſſeſſion, moſt blaſphemouſly adding, that <hi>Ferguſon</hi> ſhould firſt conſecrate it.</p>
            <p>It is indeed a thing prodigious to tell, and were it not for the undeniable proofs of it, very difficult to be believ'd, that not only one or two ſuch Furies ſhould rife up in a whole Age, but that ſo great a Number of Men ſhould, in the ſame time and place, be found ſo void of all Humanity, as not only to imagine and contrive ſo horrid a Fact, but to diſcourſe of it in ſo many Meetings, ſo ſportfully and merrily as they did, as if the cruelleſt Tragedy which wicked Men or the Devil ever invented, had been only a matter of common paſtime and looſe raillery. Thus when at one of their Conſults <hi>Weſt</hi> invited <hi>Rumzey</hi> to be Godfather to his Child, he anſwered, <hi>He would, if he might be allow'd to call him</hi> Brutus. And when it was once propoſed to Kill the King and the Duke at the <hi>Play-Houſe,</hi> by blowing up the whole Audience with them, <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſon</hi> approved the way, and impudently ſaid, <hi>That then they would Die in their own Calling.</hi> And when ſome objected againſt it, <hi>That by this means the Innocent would periſh with the Nocent;</hi> another juſtified it, ſaying, <hi>What did the Jack-Daws
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37494:47"/>do amongſt the Rooks?</hi> And when ſome propoſed that to give a better colour to what they did, the King and Duke ſhould not be killed, but only ſeiz'd and brought to Tryal, after that the People had got the better; it was anſwer'd by <hi>Ferguſon, That it was never thought In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to ſhoot, or ſet Traps for Wolves and Tygers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The execrable Deed being thus ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by them to be feaſible without much Oppoſition, they then farther conſider'd the ſeveral ways of their eſcaping after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Sometimes they thought of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating towards <hi>Cambridgeſhire,</hi> and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering there; ſometimes of retiring into the <hi>Rye-Houſe,</hi> which being guarded with a Moat, and Brick-Walls, they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to defend it againſt the frighted Country People for ſome Hours till Night, when they might ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and diſperſe. Another way that <hi>Rumbald</hi> himſelf propoſed, was to lead them out of the great Road through the Meadows, which were to be gallop'd all along; ſo that they might with eaſe come into <hi>London</hi> by <hi>Hackney-Marſh,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the News of what was done could poſſibly get thither. It was concluded at the ſame time, that divers Lords, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37494:48"/>principal Men of their Party, ſhould be invited to an Entertainment that very day in the City, that they might be upon the place to Head the Faction at the firſt arrival of the News.</p>
            <p>But whilſt they were thus wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent on this barbarous Work, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſecurely in its Contrivance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the leaſt doubt of a proſperous ſucceſs; Behold! on a ſudden God mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly diſappointed all their Hopes and Deſigns, by the terrible Conflagration, unexpectedly breaking out at <hi>Newmarket.</hi> In which extraordinary event, there was one moſt remarkable paſſage, that is not ſo generally taken notice of, as for the Glory of God, and the Confuſion of His Majeſties Enemies it ought to be.</p>
            <p>For after that the approaching fury of the Flames had driven the King out of his own Palace, His Majeſty at firſt removed into another Quarter of the Town, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the Fire, and as yet free from any annoyance of Smoke and Aſhes. There His Majeſty finding he might be tolerably well accommodated, had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſtay, and continue his Recreations as before, till the Day firſt named for his Journey back to <hi>London.</hi> But His Majeſty had no ſooner made that reſolution,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37494:48"/>when the Wind, as conducted by an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Power from above, preſently chang'd about, and blew the Smoke and Cinders directly on his new Lodgings, making them in a moment as untenable as the other. Upon this, His Majeſty being put to a new ſhift, and not finding the like Conveniency elſe-where, immediately declared he would ſpeedily return to <hi>Whitehal;</hi> as he did: which happening to be ſeveral days before the Aſſaſſines expected him, or their preparations for the <hi>Rye</hi> were in readineſs, it may juſtly give occaſion to all the World to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what one of the very Conſpirators could not but do, <hi>That it was a Providential Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now upon the firſt notice in Town of the Fire at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence the King would be neceſſitated to come home ſooner than was imagin'd, the principal Aſſaſſines were ſummon'd by <hi>Ferguſon</hi> to a Meeting that very Night.</p>
            <p>They at firſt receiv'd the News with various Apprehenſions and Motions of Mind, looking on one another with much Aſtoniſhment and Confuſion. Amongſt the reſt, <hi>Walcot</hi> acknowledg'd, <hi>He thought it an Expreſſion of Gods diſapproving the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37494:49"/>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking:</hi> whilſt <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> without any ſign of the leaſt relenting, ſaid, <hi>That he perceiv'd God had reſerv'd His Majeſty for his own Judgment.</hi> However, that Evening they generally agreed, That ſince Arms, Horſes and Men could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in ſo ſhort a ſpace, becauſe the King was daily expected, and the day of his coming uncertain, therefore all farther thoughts of the buſineſs ſhould be laid aſide for that time.</p>
            <p>Yet the next Morning, the Company being again aſſembled, upon Reports ſpread abroad that His Majeſty purpos'd to retire to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and ſtay there ſome days, <hi>Ferguſon</hi> vehemently inſiſted, <hi>That the Deſign ſhould inſtantly be reaſſum'd; That what could be, ſhould be done in ſo narrow a time.</hi> And particularly <hi>Armſtrong</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd himſelf to go down in perſon to the <hi>Rye</hi> in order to it, if a Sum of Mony could be preſently rais'd, and a competent number of Men got together.</p>
            <p>But the noiſe of the <hi>Cambridge</hi> Journey ſoon vaniſhing, put an end to thoſe Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations; though it was a conſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation and whiſper among the Party, that ſome hing extraordinary would be done on the very day of His Majeſties coming home.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:37494:49"/>
            <p>In theſe uncertainties they remain'd till the King came; and ſome days after <hi>R. Rumbald</hi> returning from the <hi>Rye,</hi> increas'd their rage for this defeat, by telling them, <hi>That he ſaw His Majeſty and his Royal Highneſs paſs by his Houſe but very ſlender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guarded, only with five or ſix Perſons, and thoſe tired, and ill appointed; ſo that he doubted not but with the like number of ſtout and well-arm'd Men, he might eaſily have taken them both off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this, preſently after at their next Meetings it was agreed, That to prepare againſt any ſuch diſappointment for the future, a ſufficient Number of Arms ſhould be bought, and kept in readineſs for any other opportunity, if ſuch could be found during any of His Majeſties Journies that Summer; or at fartheſt in his next going to <hi>Newmarket.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpoſe <hi>West</hi> told them he was acquainted with a very good Gun-ſmith, and took upon himſelf to provide the Arms; <hi>Ferguſon</hi> engaging to pay the Mony for them.</p>
            <p>Accordingly <hi>Weſt</hi> bought Thirty Caſe of Piſtols, Thirty Carabines, and Ten Blunderbuſſes of one <hi>Daft</hi> a Gun-ſmith in <hi>Sheer-Lane;</hi> and <hi>Ferguſon</hi> paid him for them about three weeks before the Diſcovery.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:37494:50"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Weſt</hi>'s pretence of buying ſo great a quantity of Arms, was to ſend them into <hi>America,</hi> where he had a Plantation; and to diſguiſe the buſineſs the better, he caus'd them to be ſanguin'd, in ſhew to preſerve them from Ruſt in ſo long a Voyage, and had them made up in Sea-Cheſts, as ready to be Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported.</p>
            <p>So they continu'd till after the noiſe of <hi>Keeling</hi>'s having betray'd all. Then <hi>Weſt</hi> to avoid ſuſpicion ſent them to a Sea-Captain, ſetting Sail for the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> but without any Bill of Lading or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment, as is uſual; in whoſe Cuſtody the Arms were ſeiz'd, and delivered into His Majeſties Stores, to be there kept for a better uſe.</p>
            <p>In theſe their ſeveral Conſults many caſual Diſcourſes interven'd, relating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently either to the Inſurrection or Aſſaſſination: As, What Commiſſions were at firſt requiſite to be given out, and in what ſtyle they were to run. What Declaration was to be immediately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd to juſtifie the Fact. What Project of Government to be pitch'd on, and ſetled afterwards.</p>
            <p>It was agreed that the Commiſſions for this Nation ſhould be iſſued forth in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37494:50"/>the Name of the Confederate Lords and Commons of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For preparing a Declaration, divers of their Number were order'd to bring in their Conceptions apart, out of all which Collection, a compleat Remonſtrance was to be gather'd by ſome of their ableſt Heads.</p>
            <p>The main drift of the whole was to amuſe the Peoples Fancies for a Time with new Chimera's of Freedom from Taxes, and Advantages for Trade, and Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Law Expenſes, and a Toleration of all Sects; then to calumniate the Royal Family for divers Generations paſt; to aſperſe His Majeſty as a Tyrant and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor, and to accuſe all his Faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as ſervile Inſtruments of Arbitrary Power, and Betrayers of their Country: Whilſt they and their Party were to be magnified, as the only Aſſerters and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorers of Liberties, Properties, and the True Proteſtant Religion. Their deſign in all this being the ſame that has been conſtantly put in practiſe by all Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Sedition and Treaſon in all Ages; Who have always thought they have done more than Half their buſineſs, if they can but once appropriate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all the Good and pleaſing Words of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37494:51"/>things plauſible and popular; and faſten on the Government the Names and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of things vulgarly odious, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.</p>
            <p>Touching the new Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be ſet up in ſtead of the old, they were not altogether ſo unanimous, that being alſo natural to all Schiſms and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that tho they may ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in what they would ruine, yet they never did, nor can long conſent in what they ſhall ſettle.</p>
            <p>Some were ſtill for retaining a ſhew of Monarchy, though with ſuch Reſtrictions as would make the Prince little better than a Duke of <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others were poſitively for a Common-Wealth, and the entire ſubverſion of the preſent conſtitution, openly declaring, it was their purpoſe not only to change Names, but Things.</p>
            <p>Nay upon this Point, ſome of them doubted not frequently to profeſs in plain Terms, <hi>That if their great Darling, the Puke of</hi> Monmouth, <hi>ſhould be ſqueamiſh,</hi> as they worded it, <hi>in Approving and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming what had been done in Heat of Blood, then be himſelf ſhould fare no better than the reſt, when their Swords were in their Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:37494:51"/>
            <p>A ſufficient Admonition to all Men of Quality and Eſtate, how hazardous their condition is, and how mean their Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, whilſt they are heading popular Tumults; tho for a little time perhaps they may ſeem to others, and fancy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to have an abſolute ſway over them.</p>
            <p>But their particular Head of Diſcourſe in which the Conſpirators chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, and were wont in their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings moſt amply to enlarge their inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was concerning their reſolutions of ſeveral kinds of vengeance to be Executed on thoſe Eminent Perſons of all Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, whom they thought moſt capable and willing to oppoſe their Bloody En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.</p>
            <p>In that part indeed their Paſſion tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported them beyond all bounds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prudence, even to the higheſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ridiculous Vanity, and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Oſtentation of their full aſſurance to ſucceed in the dire Attempt.</p>
            <p>Having firſt Gloried in the Imagination of imbruing their Hands in Royal Blood, they ſcrupled not to profeſs they would continue the Aſſaſſination on all the principal Officers of the Crown, and Miniſters of Juſtice; and ſpightfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:37494:52"/>all Circumſtances imaginable which they thought might aggravate the Terrour or Ignominy of their Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John More,</hi> the Lord Mayor of the former Year, and Sir <hi>William Pritchard</hi> the Lord Mayor, and Mr. <hi>North</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> the Sheriffs of that preſent Year, were concluded fit to be Murder'd, and their Skins ſtuff'd and hung up in <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> for a dreadful Warning, to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Alderman <hi>Corniſh</hi> or <hi>Gould</hi> was to be declared Lord Mayor; <hi>Papillion</hi> and <hi>Dubois</hi> Sheriffs: If they refuſed, they were to undergo as bad a fate. Some others alſo were doom'd to the like deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who might think they deſerved well of the Faction by their Moderation. But they reſolved that Neuters ſhould be treated as ill as their moſt avow'd E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the Judges were to be kill'd for their pretended Illegal and Arbitrary Judgments, and their Skins in the ſame manner hung up in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some of the Principal Abhorrers, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſers, and reputed Penſioners in the late Long Parliament, (under which Titles in their Modern Opprobious Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:37494:52"/>they had been us'd to comprehend the moſt ſteddy Adherents to the Crown, and True Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) were to be brought to Tryal, and Death: The Skins too of thoſe they ſtyled Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners were to be hung up in the Houſe of Commons.</p>
            <p>The Church-men they hated, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed in general, as Men whoſe Intereſt could never be divided from the Crown, and of courſe would fall with it.</p>
            <p>The Marquiſs of <hi>Hallifax,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> Sir <hi>Leolyn Jenkins,</hi> the Lord Keeper, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who had been His Majesties moſt faithful Councellors in the time of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme hazard, were nam'd as Men whoſe Deſtruction was certain, and who could not poſſibly eſcape the firſt rage of the Maſſacre. Particularly it was determin'd the Lord Keeper ſhould be ſent to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and hang'd on the ſame Gallows on which the Infamous <hi>College</hi> had been Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
            <p>In this furious manner they proceeded to lay about them in their common Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes with all the Infernal Malice that is ſo agreeable to their Principles, and inſeparable from them; there never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving yet been found, in all Records of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37494:53"/>Time, any pretended Conſcientious Zeal, but it was always moſt certainly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a fierce Spirit of implacable Cruelty.</p>
            <p>During all this time, as it cannot be imagin'd that either of the Cabals was altogether unacquainted with what the other was doing; ſo it is manifeſt, ſome of their great Men underſtood the dark Hints that were ſometimes given them, of <hi>Striking at the Head,</hi> and <hi>Shortning the Work by removing two Perſons:</hi> And alſo that theſe Inferiour Inſtruments proceeded on aſſurance, That <hi>when they came to Action, they ſhould he Headed by Men of much higher Quality and Condition than as yet openly appear'd amongſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore of the Debates and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of their great Council, thus much has been already teſtified upon Oath: That ſhortly after that the Earl of <hi>Shaftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> fled, it was thought expedient, for the furtherance of the Deſign projected in his time, that a ſmall Select Number of the moſt eminent Heads of the Party, in and about <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ſhould be united into a cloſe Cabal, or ſecret Council; who might have their frequent Aſſemblies, and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, on all occaſions, to guide and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37494:53"/>the motions of the Lower A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.</p>
            <p>The Perſons, who undertook this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal care and inſpection, were the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> Colonel <hi>Algernoon Sydney,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Hambden</hi> Junior. Beſides that, <hi>Romzey, Armſtrong, Ferguſon, Shepard,</hi> and ſome others, were admitted, as occaſion ſerv'd, on ſome particular Debates.</p>
            <p>Their firſt Meeting was in <hi>January</hi> of thar Year at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s Houſe: Where ſome general Heads were propounded of things to be reſolv'd on, in their more mature thoughts. As, Where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection ſhould firſt be made, in City or Country, or in both at once: What Counties were moſt diſpoſed for Action: What places would be moſt proper for their Rendezvouſes: What Arms were neceſſary, how to be provided, where to be laid in: What Mony needful at firſt to be rais'd, and where to be depoſited, ſo as to Adminiſter no Ground of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie: And by what means the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Party in <hi>Scotland</hi> might be brought into the Confederacy.</p>
            <p>This laſt was look'd on as the principal Point, and deſerving their firſt Direction.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:37494:54"/>Wherefore at their next Meeting about ten days after, at the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Houſe, they began with conſidering a way of Setling an Intelligence with the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> beyond the Seas, and with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this a Meſſenger was Ordered to be ſent into <hi>Scotland:</hi> It was committed to Colonel <hi>Sydney,</hi> to chooſe the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to furniſh him with Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>The Man choſen by Mr. <hi>Sydney,</hi> at the recommendation of <hi>Nelthrop,</hi> for his known merits towards the Cauſe, was <hi>Aaron Smith.</hi> The Sum given him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray his Expenſes, was Three, or Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Guinea's. The ſubſtance of his Meſſage was to invite up Sir <hi>John Cockran,</hi> the <hi>Cambells</hi> of <hi>Ceſſnock,</hi> and ſome others, to treat in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Information ſtops. For then the Managers ſeem'd to agree amongſt themſelves to have no more conſtant Aſſemblies, till the return of the Meſſenger. Tho ſince it appears, the ſaid Lord was thereafter excluded from their Conſutations, for having been too laviſh with his Tongue, in reporting abroad what had been there tranſacted.</p>
            <p>However it has been proved by unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37494:54"/>Evidence, that preſently after this, <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> did ſet forth towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> arrived there the Spring of that Year; and by ſome indiſcretion had like to have ſpoil'd the whole buſineſs: Which to recover, and to remove all ſuſpicions, <hi>Cockran</hi> was forc'd to preſent himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards he and his Companions came to Town, and the Negotiation was warmly ſet on Foot: In the mean time <hi>Cockran</hi> and the reſt often attended at <hi>Windſor</hi> to make their Court, one day kiſſing the King's and the Duke's Hands, the next conſulting with the Engliſh Cabal; all in ſhew to ſollicite the Intereſt of <hi>Carolina,</hi> whilſt they really intended a Buſineſs of far greater Importance, which was, in their own Language, <hi>To ſee what could be done for the delivery of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time the late Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> for his part had deputed ſome of his Confidents hither to attend the iſſue of thoſe Debates, to repreſent his Propoſals, and to tranſmit to him the Reſults of their Counſels; the whole correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them being veil'd under a ſtyle of Merchandize.</p>
            <p>The Treaty being thus begun, ſome
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:37494:55"/>general Things were eaſily agreed on by all ſides. The Scots were to riſe firſt; the Engliſh to have notice of it with all poſſible ſpeed, then to ſecond them here: The Rebellion in both Kingdoms to be before Harveſt: Arms and Ammunition to be tranſported out of <hi>Holland: Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle</hi> to go with them and Head the Riſing.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being quickly paſs'd over, ſome other Matters endured a longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; and one unſeaſonable Diſpute had like to have broken all; The Engliſh Commiſſioners requir'd, <hi>They ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently declare for a Commonwealth and the Extirpation of Monarchy;</hi> which the Scots refuſed, proteſting, <hi>The generality of their People would never hearken to that at firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the great Point on which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the whole depended, was the Sum of Mony to be rais'd, and intruſted with the Scots to lay out: The Sum at firſt demanded was Thirty Thouſand Pounds; that ſunk afterwards to Ten Thouſand; But for the raiſing of this, the Engliſh made ſeveral delays and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, being willing to truſt their Scotch Brethren with any thing but Mony.</p>
            <p>Upon this Contraſt the Treaty was
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37494:55"/>often on and off; the Scots talking high, objecting to the Engliſh, <hi>That they were only good at Fire-ſide Plotting; whereas for their part they were reſolv'd to riſe, though they had nothing but their Claws to fight with.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At length they came to an Agreement, <hi>That the Ten Thouſand Pounds ſhould be rais'd, and put into the Hands</hi> of Shepard, <hi>who was to return the Bills for it by</hi> Fergu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>or</hi> Baillie <hi>to</hi> Amſterdam.</p>
            <p>After this manner was the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy going on, when the Diſcovery overtook it. For now the happy Twelfth of <hi>June</hi> was come. <hi>Joſiah Keeling</hi> had ſworn to his firſt Depoſition before Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins:</hi> But finding that His Majeſty and his Miniſters were exceeding diffident of his ſingle intelligence in a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of ſo vaſt a Moment, he conſider'd which way he might beſt ſtrengthen his Evidence. To that end he prevail'd with <hi>Goodenough,</hi> who had an entire confidence in him, that his Brother <hi>John Keeling</hi> might be admitted into the next Meetings of the Conſpirators, he himſelf promiſing to be anſwerable for his Secrecy.</p>
            <p>This was done, and thereupon both the Brothers gave in their joynt Teſtimony upon Oath on the 14th of <hi>June,</hi> touching
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:37494:56"/>the progreſs of the Treaſon. So they continued to do for a day or two more, tilt <hi>John Keeling</hi> let fall ſome Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to his Relations, which they whiſper'd about among their Fanatick Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>That,</hi> as they call'd it, <hi>ſomething was working which might do miſchief to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That being rumour'd about, came quickly to the Knowledge of ſome of the Conſpirators. Upon this they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately aſſembled, and <hi>Rumbald</hi> declar'd his Fears of <hi>Keeding</hi>'s Treachery, and that were he ſure of it, he would inſtantly get him knock'd on the Head. But <hi>Keeling</hi> coming in amongſt them ſomewhat cleer'd himſelf, and allay'd their Jealouſie, by many aſſeverations of his fidelity to the common Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Soon after they met again, when it was ſuggeſted, that <hi>Keeling</hi> had been ſeen about. <hi>Whitehal</hi> and on the Road to <hi>Windſor,</hi> where His Majeſty then reſided: But <hi>Keeling</hi> ſtill frequenting their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, renew'd the Proteſtations of his Innocency; pretended his going to <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal</hi> was upon other buſineſs; complain'd he was in great want of Mony; upon which one Hundred Pounds, the Sum he told them he ſtood in need of, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37494:56"/>rais'd and lent him that Evening, leſt his Want ſhould be a Temptation to him.</p>
            <p>But their diſtruſt increaſing every Hour, it was mention'd to <hi>Keeling,</hi> that the beſt way for him to render himſelf unſuſpected, would be to withdraw out of Town for ſome ſhort time, <hi>Rumbald</hi> offering him his Houſe to retire to. <hi>Keeling</hi> ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd by many Imprecations to quiet their Suſpicions of him; but perſiſted that he could not go into the Country, by reaſon of urgent buſineſs of his Calling and Family.</p>
            <p>So for that time he got ſafe out of their Hands, which they afterwards extreamly regretted; ſome of them owning that it was their purpoſe, if they could have got him abroad, to have kill'd and privately Buried him.</p>
            <p>But ſhortly after this, they heard that Warrants were out againſt divers of them, and therefore agreed to meet on <hi>Monday June</hi> 18th, at <hi>Walcot</hi>'s Lodgings in <hi>Goodman</hi>'s-<hi>Fields,</hi> to conſult once for all what ſhould be done for their common ſafety.</p>
            <p>Accordingly at that time there met <hi>Walcot, Norton, Wade, Romzey,</hi> the two <hi>Goodenoughs, Nelthrop, Weſt, Ferguſon.</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:37494:57"/>Their Opinions were very different what courſe was to be taken. <hi>Weſt</hi> once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that all ſhould ſtand their ground, and by a bold Denial, and their Perſonal Credit, out-face and baffle <hi>Keelings</hi> ſingle Word. But the conſciouſneſs of their own Guilt would not let them hearken to that advice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wade</hi> and ſome others offer'd, as <hi>Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong</hi> had done to ſome of them juſt before, That things ſhould ſtill be put to a Puſh, that if a Thouſand Men could be got together, and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> at the Head of them, ſomething might ſtill be done: At the worſt it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them to Dye like Men, than to be hang'd like Dogs. But that was alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as a wild and deſperate courſe. <hi>Romzey</hi> and the reſt alledging their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Hearts were down, and accuſing their great Men for want of Spirit and Reſolution.</p>
            <p>Then they determin'd upon flying; and had ſome thoughts of hiring a Veſſel im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to tranſport them into <hi>Holland.</hi> But finding, on Inquiry, that the Boat could not be clear'd at the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> till next Morning, nor at <hi>Graveſend</hi> till the Afternoon, they concluded that would be too late; and therefore
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:37494:57"/>every Man was left to ſhift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>So they ſeparated in much Terrour and Confuſion. Only <hi>Walcot,</hi> according to the conſtant ſacrilegious way of the whole Party, to intitle the Almighty to their greateſt Impieties, ſaid at parting, <hi>God would yet deliver the Nation, though he did not approve of the preſent Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> And <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> to keep up the ſame Character of remorſeleſs Villany to the laſt, took his leave of them in theſe very words, <hi>That he perceived they were Strangers to this kind of Exerciſe, but he had been uſed to fly, and would never be out of a Plot as long as he liv'd; and that he hoped yet to meet ſome of them at</hi> Dunbar <hi>before</hi> Michaelmas.</p>
            <p>Now a day or two before this their final ſeparation, the King and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil began to be convinc'd of the truth of <hi>Keeling</hi>'s Evidence, by a full knowledge of the Witneſſes Character, and by the firmneſs and conſiſtency of his Tiſtimony; beſides many other concurring Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Wherefore His Majeſty order'd Warrants ſhould be iſſued out againſt the Perſons accus'd, whereof ſome ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſconded, others were taken. Of theſe laſt, divers confirm'd what <hi>Keeling</hi> had
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:37494:58"/>ſworn, and named others as Partakers in the Treaſon. Whereupon more and more appearing every day to have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, Proclamations were Publiſh'd in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> for their ſpeedy Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. By this means, through the Providence of God, ſo many of them were either ſeiz'd, or deliver'd themſelves up, as have irrefragably confirm'd every part of the foregoing Account. What became of the ſeveral Conſpirators, will appear by the following Liſt:</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>William Carſtares, William Spence, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Gourdon</hi> of <hi>Earlſton</hi> taken, the two firſt in Town, the laſt at <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the poſitive Confeſſion of theſe three Scotch men, together with that of Major <hi>Holms,</hi> who were the Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle</hi>'s chief Agents in this buſineſs, was the firſt greateſt light given of the ſaid Earls part in the Conſpiracy.</p>
               <p>Of theſe, <hi>Alexander Gourdon</hi> Laird of <hi>Earlſton</hi> was a Zealous Field-Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cler, and had been a <hi>Bothwel-Bridge</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel: Where, upon the rout of their Army, his Father was kill'd, and he taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Having afterwards got his Liberty, he became Sollicitor for the Faction, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> under pretence of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting Contributions for maintaining ſuch of them as were denounc'd Fugitives; for which purpoſe he had a formal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſign'd and ſeal'd in the Name of the General Aſſembly of their Party at <hi>Edenburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before any Diſcovery, he was taken at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> under a feigned Name, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:37494:61"/>to get a paſſage beyond the Seas. About him were ſeiz'd divers O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Papers, which as ſoon as he was made Priſoner, he try'd to make private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly away, but the Kings Officers obſerving his deſign, ſecur'd them.</p>
               <p>Amongſt theſe Papers, there was one very remarkable Letter written to him under another Counterfeit Name of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle.</hi> The Compoſer of it was <hi>John Niſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,</hi> one of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Agents in <hi>London.</hi> It was dated <hi>March</hi> the 20th of that Year, when the Conſpiracy was in the heighth. It gives a perfect account of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition at that time during the Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons between the Engliſh and Scottiſh Traytors: Whilſt they ſometimes hoped the Treaty would take effect; ſometimes fear'd it would break off without coming to any Reſolution.</p>
               <p>Amongſt many other myſterious inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of Treaſon, <hi>Nisbet</hi> tells him, <hi>That Trading being very low here, and many breaking daily, deſperate Diſeaſes muſt have deſperate Cures: That while they had ſome Stock left, it would be better to venture out, than to keep Shop till all be gone; for after this they ſhould not be able to act, but muſt let all go: That he had been ſhew'd a Model of Affairs, in ſuch order as he ſaw; venture
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:37494:61"/>they muſt, and venture they would: That now they knew what Goods had been moſt prejudicial to the Trade: And therefore for the future, reſolv'd to inſiſt only on Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; this being the beſt way to ſtill ſome Criticks of the Trade: That they would firſt endeavour to diſpatch the Old Stuff: That ſome Stock was to be got, to ſet the broken Merchants up again: That if all holds that is intended, it is almoſt time to ſet forward, if they had but their Factors and Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries home, who are gone forth to try how Countries will like their Goods: That they will return within a Week: Then matters will</hi> in inſtanti <hi>off or on, Break, or go through: That if any ſtrange thing ſhould fall out in the mean time, he would poſt it to him: That things were full as High as he had Written.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome amongſt divers others of the Covert Significations of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, contain'd in <hi>Nisbet</hi>'s Letter; which being taken about <hi>Gourdon,</hi> and ſent with him into <hi>Scotland,</hi> after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Examinations before the Council there, he plainly detected what was the true ſenſe hidden under the Myſtical Style of every Expreſſion in the whole Letter.</p>
               <p>Particularly, That by <hi>the Merchants
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:37494:62"/>here being low, and often breaking,</hi> was meant the Proſecution of Diſſenters by Excommunications, or other legal ways: That therefore they had reſolved upon a deſperate Cure, which was Riſing in Arms: That <hi>the Model of Affairs which would make them venture,</hi> was the Method then going on in order to a Riſing: That <hi>by only inſiſting on Negatives,</hi> was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Conſpirators agreeing what they ſhould pull down, which was the whole Government, but not determining po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively at firſt what they ſhould ſet up: That <hi>by Criticks in the Trade,</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd the old Scotch Fanaticks, who had ſo often rebell'd. That <hi>Excluding the old Rotten Stuff,</hi> was the Deſtruction of the entire Frame of the antient Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Civil and Eccleſiaſtical: That <hi>the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Merchants to be ſet up,</hi> were the baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled Scotch-Whigs to be ſpirited again with new aſſiſtance: That <hi>their being here at a point to ſet forward,</hi> was the Engliſh Conſpirators being ready for a Rendezvous: That <hi>the Factors and Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,</hi> were People ſent forth through <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> to try Mens Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations towards a General Inſurrection: That by ſaying, <hi>That upon thoſe Factors return, Matters would be ſoon on or off,</hi> was
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:37494:62"/>intended, that when their Agents were come back to give an account of their ſucceſs, accordingly the Deſign would be either deferr'd longer, or they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly riſe: That <hi>the ſtrange thing</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, was a ſpeedy Inſurrection: That <hi>by things being full as high as he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> was imply'd the Rebellion was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ripe, and ready to break forth.</p>
               <p>This is the ſubſtance of the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Letter of Trade</hi> that <hi>Gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> of <hi>Earlſton</hi> gave in upon Oath at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Examinations. He moreover con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, That upon receipt of this Letter he preſently came into <hi>England,</hi> where he had frequent Conferences with <hi>Nisbet</hi> touching the Contents of every Clauſe in it, who always underſtood it in this ſenſe: That by him and divers others he was made fully acquainted with the Treaty then going on in <hi>London,</hi> and with the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Correſpondence with the Perſons treating for a ſpeedy Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in both Nations.</p>
               <p>Another Scotch-Man whose cleer and undoubted Teſtimony has put this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy between the Engliſh and Scotch Traytors out of all Queſtion, is <hi>William Carſtares,</hi> who had been a Zealous and Fierce Preacher to the Sectaries of both
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:37494:63"/>Kingdoms: And was formerly Priſoner in <hi>Edenburgh-Caſtle,</hi> being accus'd for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing a Treaſonable Pamphlet, call'd, <hi>The Grievances of</hi> Scotland.</p>
               <p>At that time he was much employ'd in many Meſſages relating to this Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy: Eſpecially with Major <hi>Holms</hi> in diſperſing the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Libellous Books, and carrying too and fro his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in which <hi>Carſtares</hi> paſs'd under the Name of <hi>Read.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was apprehended at <hi>Tenterden</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> ſeeking an opportunity of flying beyond Sea. He was taken under the Name of <hi>William Swan,</hi> then declar'd his true Name was <hi>Moor,</hi> but at laſt own'd it was <hi>Carſtares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Carſtares</hi> being brought before the the King, and refuſing to confeſs any more than ſome general Hints; alledging, <hi>That it was no place for him to anſwer in a Criminal Matter;</hi> Upon that he was ſent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where being Examined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords of the Secret Committee, <hi>September</hi> 8th 1684, he confeſs'd and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards renew'd and confirm'd the ſame Confeſſion <hi>November</hi> 18th, and <hi>December</hi> 22th of the ſame Year.</p>
               <p>His Depoſition having been already made Publick, it will be enough only to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:37494:63"/>note ſome ſpecial Heads of what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. He confeſs'd, <q>That <hi>James Steuart,</hi> Brother to the Laird of <hi>Cultneſs,</hi> wrote to him out of <hi>Holland</hi> in <hi>November</hi> or <hi>December</hi> 1682. the Letter importing, That if a conſiderable Sum of Mony could be procur'd from <hi>England,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Importance might be done in <hi>Scotland:</hi> That this Letter he Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to <hi>Shepard,</hi> and he to Colonel <hi>Syd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Danvers</hi> being preſent: That <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard</hi> return'd anſwer, Mr. <hi>Sydney</hi> was averſe from medling with the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> ſuſpecting him to be too much inclin'd to the Royal Family, and the preſent Government: That the ſaid <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtares</hi> ſtill urg'd one might be ſent to the Earl of <hi>Argyle:</hi> That not being able to obtain this, for the foreſaid Reaſon, he himſelf went into <hi>Holland,</hi> was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Earl, and there diſcours'd with him particularly about remitting the Money to him from <hi>England,</hi> and raiſing 1000 Horſe and Dragoons, and ſurprizing <hi>Edenburgh-Caſtle.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>That the Earls anſwer was, The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles would fall to them of courſe, after that the Work was done abroad: That without a Thouſand Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons rais'd in <hi>England</hi> to be ready to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:37494:64"/>aſſiſt them, nothing could be done: That if ſuch a Number could be rais'd, he would come into <hi>Scotland</hi> with them; whereby he gueſs'd he might get that Country without trouble, having ſuch a ſtanding Body for their Friends to Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous to.</p>
                  <p>That the ſaid Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Deponent to Major <hi>Holmes:</hi> That <hi>James Steuart</hi> contriv'd a way of Correſpondence by Cyphers and falſe Names, and ſent them over to <hi>Holmes,</hi> and the Deponent for their uſe; and ſtill deſir'd him to preſs for the 30000 <hi>l.</hi> and did not propoſe any leſt Sum, the ſaid Earl ſaying he had particularly calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the Expence for Arms and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though <hi>Steuart</hi> added, If ſomething leſs could be had, the Earl would content himſelf.</p>
                  <p>That when the Deponent was ready to ſhip for <hi>England, Steuart</hi> writ him word there was hope of the Mony: That the Day after he arrived here he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted Sir <hi>John Cockran</hi> with the ſaid Earls demands of the Sum of Mony, and the Horſe and Dragoons: That Sir <hi>John Cochran</hi> carried him to the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> to whom the Deponent propos'd the Affair; but being a ſtranger, had no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:37494:64"/>from him at that time: That after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards having met the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> at <hi>Shepard</hi>'s Houſe, where <hi>Shepard</hi> told him the ſaid Lord was come to ſpeak with him about the Mony, the Deponent reiterated to the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> the former Propoſition for 30000 <hi>l.</hi> and the 1000 Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons; the ſaid Lord anſwering, They could not get ſuch a Sum rais'd at the time; but if they had 10000 <hi>l.</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with, that would draw People in, and when they were once in, they would ſoon be brought to more; but as for the Horſe and Dragoons, he could ſay nothing at preſent, for that behoved to be concerted on the Borders.</p>
                  <p>That the Deponent made the ſame propoſal to <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> who was much concerned and Zealous in promoting it; and told him, He was doing what he could to get it effected; always blaming Colonel <hi>Sydney,</hi> for driving on deſigns of his own.</p>
                  <p>That the ſaid Deponent met twice or thrice with <hi>Melvin, Cochran, Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſwood, Monroe,</hi> the two <hi>Cambells</hi> of <hi>Ceſſnock, Mongomery</hi> of <hi>Langſhaw</hi> and <hi>Veatch,</hi> where they diſcours'd of Mony to be ſent to <hi>Argyle:</hi> That <hi>Monroe, Melvin,</hi> and the <hi>Ceſſnocks</hi> were againſt medling
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:37494:65"/>with the Engliſh Conſpirators, as Men that would talk, but would not do: That therefore it were better for the Scots to attempt ſomething by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: That <hi>Veatch, Jerviſwood,</hi> and this Deponent were for accepting the Mony.</p>
                  <p>That at one of their Meetings it was agreed, one <hi>Martin,</hi> late Clerk of the Juſtice Court, ſhould be ſent into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to hinder the Country from Riſing, till they ſaw how Matters went in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> That the ſaid <hi>Martin</hi> did go at the Charge of the Gentlemen there met, and was directed to the Lairds of <hi>Polwart</hi> and <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi> who ſent back word, It would not be ſo eaſie a matter to get the Gentry of <hi>Scotland</hi> to concur; yet that afterwards <hi>Polwart</hi> writ to <hi>Monroe, That the Country was readier than they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the ſaid Deponent had the Key of the Cypher agreed on in his keeping, when a Letter came from <hi>Argyle</hi> to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Holms,</hi> intimating that the ſaid Earl would joyn with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> follow his Meaſures, and obey his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections: That for the Decyphering of this, he gave the Key to <hi>Veatch,</hi> who was to deliver the Letter to <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> and he to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi>

               <p>To all this <hi>Carſtares</hi> added in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Sept.</hi> 18. 1684. <hi>That he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had communicated the Deſign on foot to three famous Engliſh Conventicle-Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> Griffith, Mede, <hi>and</hi> Dr. Owen, <hi>who,</hi> he affirmed, <hi>did all concur in promoting it, and were deſirous it ſhould take effect;</hi> which part of <hi>Carſtares</hi>'s Oath is the more remarkable, becauſe the King ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly affirms, That the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> in his Confeſſion to His Majeſty, and his Royal Highneſs, did particularly name thoſe very three Men, as conſcious of the Plot, and withal declar'd in theſe very words, <hi>That all the conſiderable Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt Miniſters knew of the Conſpiracy.</hi> An inſtance that alone, if there were not many more ſuch, were a ſufficient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to all Separatiſts, of what ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſciences the Men are, whom they chuſe for the principal Guides of their Conſciences: Since after all this, <hi>Mede</hi> depoſed before his Majeſty, <hi>That he never heard of any Diſturbance intended againſt the Government; but that on the contrary he himſelf had once adviſed</hi> Ferguſon, <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſcourſe of ſome Libel of his then newly made publick, That it was not their part to do ſuch things.</hi> Nay, their great Oracle Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> being examin'd upon Oath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:37494:66"/>the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Jones,</hi> and being ask'd, <hi>Whether he had not heard of a Horrid Plot againſt the Life of the King?</hi> did, not long before his Death, take God to witneſs, and ſubſcrib'd to it with his dying Hand, <hi>That indeed he had heard of ſuch a Plot by the means of the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, but no otherwiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which ſtill farther undeniably confirms the Scotch part of the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with the Engliſh, was the Confeſſion of <hi>William Spence</hi> a Scotch-Man, and of Major <hi>Holmes</hi> an Engliſh-Man, the former being a Menial Servant to the Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle,</hi> the other his long Dependent and Friend; a Man active in the times of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and always diſaffected to His Majeſties Government.</p>
               <p>Major <hi>Holmes</hi> being taken in <hi>London</hi> in the beginning of the Diſcovery with ſeveral of the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Original Letters about him, and being examin'd, confeſs'd, <hi>He knew of the Earl of</hi> Argyle<hi>'s propoſing to ſome principal Men in</hi> England, <hi>That for</hi> 30000 <hi>Pounds he might he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd for his Expedition into</hi> Scotland: <hi>That the Engliſh at laſt condeſcended to ſend him</hi> 10000 <hi>Pounds: That though he had not perſonally converst with the Great Men who were to raiſe the Mony, yet he had
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:37494:66"/>often heard the Duke of</hi> Monmouth, <hi>the Lord</hi> Gray, <hi>the Lord</hi> Ruſſel <hi>named: That he himſelf was appointed by the Earl of</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle <hi>to convey Letters to and from his Counteſs and others his Correſpondents: That he could not Decypher thoſe taken about him, but that</hi> William Spence <hi>could: That this</hi> Spence <hi>went under the Name of</hi> Butler, <hi>and was juſt then come over in the Packet-Boat from</hi> Holland, <hi>to diſpoſe of the Libel, call'd,</hi> The Earl of Argyle'<hi>s</hi> Caſe.</p>
               <p>This Depoſition was given by Major <hi>Holmes,</hi> on <hi>June</hi> 29. 1683. the very day that <hi>Spence</hi> being arrived from <hi>Holland,</hi> was apprehended under the Name of <hi>Butler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides this Evidence of <hi>Holmes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Spence,</hi> it appears plainly by the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s own words in ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of his Letters, taken in <hi>Holmes</hi>'s poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, eſpecially in that part of the long Letter of the 21ſt of <hi>June,</hi> which was not written in Cypher, <hi>That the ſaid</hi> Spence, alias <hi>B.</hi> as he afterwards own'd himſelf for the Man, <hi>knew his the ſaid Earls Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and how to write to him;</hi> adding, <hi>That he could inſtruct</hi> Holmes <hi>in this Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, elſe he had loſt ſix hours Work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore upon this aſſurance that <hi>Spence</hi> could Decypher the Letters, he was
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:37494:67"/>examined before the King; but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing any thing material, and ſeeming reſolv'd not to do it, he was lent into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where he was brought to diſcover the whole Intrigue; acknowledg'd, <hi>That he himſelf was the</hi> B. <hi>or</hi> Butler <hi>mention'd in the Letters: That thoſe ſuperſcrib'd to</hi> Weſt <hi>and</hi> Robert Thomſon <hi>were directed to Major</hi> Holmes <hi>under thoſe falſe Names: That he the ſaid</hi> Spence <hi>could open the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and explain the way of reading them;</hi> which he did, and then juſtified upon Oath the Explanation he had made to be according to their true ſenſe.</p>
               <p>It happen'd alſo at the ſame time, whilſt <hi>Spence</hi> was under cloſe Examination, that Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Crechie,</hi> a Scotch Gentleman, skill'd in the Art of Cyphers, did, without any the leaſt Communication with <hi>Spence,</hi> Decypher ſome of the principal of the ſaid Earls Letters; and when both <hi>Spence</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Gray</hi>'s Copies were found to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree exactly, there could not poſſibly have been given a more certain Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Truth of <hi>Spence</hi>'s way of Decyphering, which he confeſs'd he was taught by <hi>Argyle</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>In this manner were theſe Letters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Authentick, and the right meaning of them unfolded. And it is evident by
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:37494:67"/>the plain Tenour of them, that ſome of them were written by the ſaid Earl juſt about the time that the Conſpiracy was near ripening, and when he was inform'd of Ten Thouſand Pounds only order'd to be ſent him: Others were written after he had heard that the Plot was diſcover'd.</p>
               <p>In every one of thoſe Papers it is eaſie to trace out manifeſt Footſteps of the whole Conſpiracy. But particularly that of <hi>June</hi> 21 <hi>New Style,</hi> which is <hi>June</hi> the 11th of the Engliſh, written the very day before <hi>Keeling</hi> made the firſt diſcovery, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains not only a vehement expoſtulation of the ſaid Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s touching the delay of the Mony from <hi>England,</hi> and the ſmallneſs of the Sum deſign'd; but a plain Narration how the Inſurrection was to be concerted in both Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>The Body of the Letter was written in Cypher, the Preface and Poſtſcript in plain Hand; in both there is reference made to <hi>Butler</hi>'s, that is <hi>Spence</hi>'s, being able to expound it; and from the very ſame <hi>Spence</hi> was taken the Expoſition of it upon Oath.</p>
               <p>Therein the ſaid Earl tells his Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent in <hi>England, That he knew not the Grounds their Friends had gone upon to offer ſo little Mony, nor did he understand
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:37494:68"/>what Aſſiſtance they would give: That till he knew both, and heard what</hi> Carſtares, <hi>or any other they ſhould ſend over, had to ſay, he purpos'd neither to refuſe his ſervice, nor object againſt any thing reſolv'd here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>However, that the ſaid</hi> Earl <hi>had truly mention'd in his Propoſition formerly made the very leaſt Sum he thought could do the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs effectually; which was not half of what had been requiſite in another Juncture of Affairs: That what Mony he propos'd to be rais'd, was ſo much within the power of the Perſons concern'd, that if a little leſs could do the Buſineſs, he had thought it would not he ſtood upon: That the ſaid</hi> Earl <hi>reckon'd the Aſſiſtance of the Horſe abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the firſt Bruſh: That as to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Number nam'd, he would not be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory, but he believ'd there would need that effectual Number: That</hi> 1000 <hi>might be as eaſily rais'd as</hi> 5 <hi>or</hi> 600; <hi>and it were hard if it ſtuck at the Odds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they ſhould conſider, whether all ought to be hazarded upon ſo ſmall a difference as to the Mony: That though 'tis true, what was propounded is more by half than is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the firſt Weeks Work, yet ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, all or more will be neceſſary; and then Arms cannot be ſent like Mony by Bills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That there are above</hi> 1200 <hi>Horſe and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:37494:68"/>Dragoons, and</hi> 2000 <hi>Foot at leaſt in</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; <hi>all well appointed and tolerably well commanded: That it were hard to expect Country People on Foot without Horſe ſhould beat them triple their Number: That if Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes could be got together, they would ſtill need more Arms and more Proviſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That if ſome conſiderable thing be not ſuddenly done at the firſt appearing, it may fright a little, but will do no good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the ſtanding Forces will take up ſome ſtation; probably at</hi> Stirling: <hi>That they will have for aid not only the Militia of Twenty Thouſand Foot, and</hi> 2000 <hi>Horſe, but all the Heritors, to the Number it may be of</hi> 50000 <hi>Men: That though many ſhould be unwilling to fight for the ſtanding Forces, yet moſt will once joyn, and many will be as concern'd for them, as any can be againſt them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That though the ſaid Earls Party ſhould have at firſt all the ſucceſs imaginable, yet it is impoſſible but ſome will keep together, and have aſſiſtance from all the three Kingdoms; then it will not betime to call for more Arms, far leſs for more Mony to buy them, and they ſhould then prove like the Fooliſh Virgins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is next to be conſider'd how the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Engliſh Lords could employ ſo much Mony, and ſo many Horſe, better for their own Intereſt, though the Proteſtant
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:37494:69"/>Cauſe were not concern'd; this being a little Sum, and ſmall Fonds to raiſe ſo many Men, and by Gods Bleſſing to repreſs the whole Power of</hi> Scotland.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Horſe to be ſent from</hi> England <hi>need ſtay but a little while to do a Job, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs future events ſhould make</hi> Scotland <hi>the Seat of the War; which would be yet more to the advantage of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That by the beſt Husbanding the total of the Mony propoſed, it cannot purchaſe Arms and abſolute Neceſſaries for one time, for an Army of the Number they were to deal with: That nothing out of the whole is deſign'd to be beſtow'd on many things uſeful, and ſome neceſſary, as Tents, Waggons, Cloaths, Shooes, Horſe, Horſeſhooes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All which are not only Once to be had, but daily recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, much leſs was any of it apportion'd to provide for Meat or Drink, Intelligence, or other incident Charges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſome honeſt well-meaning good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may undertake for little, becauſe they can do little, and know little what is to be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the ſaid Earl had made the reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as low as if he had been to pay it all out of his own Purſe: That he was reſolv'd never to touch the Mony; only to have it iſſued out according to Order: That he freely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to any knowing Souldier for the Liſts,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:37494:69"/>and to any skilful Merchant for the Prices be had calculated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it will be a great incouragement for Perſons of Eſtates and conſideration to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when they ſhall know there is a project and proſpect of the whole Affair, and Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries provided for ſuch an attempt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That if after the ſaid Earl ſhall have ſpoken with</hi> Carſtares, <hi>he ſees he is able to do any ſervice, he will be very willing; if he be not able, he will pray God ſome other may.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That before it be given over, he wiſhes he might have ſuch a conference as he had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in another Letter a week before: wherein he had offer'd either to come over privately in Perſon, or to meet any to be ſent from hence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he expected not all the Horſe from the diſcontented Lords, but ſome conſiderable part might be rais'd by particular Friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he had yet more to add, to inforce all he had ſaid, but it could not be expreſs'd at that diſtance: That ſomething more was to be done to prevent the Deſigns of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, which he dares not now mention, leſt it ſhould put them on their Guard: That he has a conſiderable Direction in his Head, but all is in Gods Hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a faithful and impartial Abſtract
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:37494:70"/>of the Myſtical Letter; than which, how could there have been expreſs'd by words a more compleat Deduction of the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi>'s part in the deſign'd Inſurrection?</p>
               <p>Immediately after the Cyphers, this follows in words at large, <hi>The Total Sum is</hi> 128 <hi>Guilders, and</hi> 8 <hi>Stivers, that will be paid you by Mr.</hi> B.</p>
               <p>Which laſt Clauſe was the Rule where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> found out, and <hi>Spence</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the Decyphering of the whole Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and it was accordingly done by each of them apart, by making eight Columns, and placing 128 words in each Column deſcending, as upon view of the Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Printed Copies will appear to any Man beyond all Contradiction.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, this Letter of the late <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s was known by many of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Council thereto be his Hand; and his own Lady upon Oath depoſed, <hi>She knew it to be his, though ſhe did not know the Contents of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſuch is the Account that is to be given of the ſaid Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Loyalty, which he had deſir'd might be the only Standard in what ſenſe he would take the <hi>Teſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto he had been by Inheritance Lord High Admiral and Juſtice General
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:37494:70"/>of <hi>Argyle, Tarbat,</hi> and the Iſles, and Great Maſter of the Houſhold. He was by His Majeſty put into Places of great Dignity and Truſt; he was made extraordinary Lord of the Seſſion, one of His Majeſties Privy Council, and one of the Lords Commiſſioners of the Treaſury. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Fathers Condemnation for the higheſt Crimes, and his own Forfeiture of his Honour and Eſtate for Treaſonable Expreſſions in a Letter of his, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to all his Father poſſeſs'd, except the Title of Marquiſs. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all theſe, and many more Obligations of the like nature which he had to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, his fondneſs of eſteem with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious People, his averſion to Monarchy, and hatred of the Royal Family, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> led him to this height of Ingratitude.</p>
               <p>This, and divers other Letters of the like Traiterous importance, all written with <hi>Argyle</hi>'s own Hand, being at one and the ſame time taken about Major <hi>Holmes,</hi> the Perſon chiefly intruded by the ſaid Earl to receive and convey all his Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondences with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> it cannot be doubted but very many more Papers of the ſame dangerous Tenor had been this way interchang'd between him
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:37494:71"/>and the Engliſh and Scotch Conſpirators, during the whole progreſs of the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Eſpecially conſidering, that in ſome of theſe, the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> refers to ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and Propoſitions which he ſays he had made in others; and there are no ſuch Expreſſions to be met with in all theſe Letters that are taken: Beſides that with the Letters themſelves there were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſeiz'd about <hi>Holmes</hi> ſeveral Alphabets, and a Key of Words; whereas of one of the Alphabets there has been as yet no uſe found in Decyphering; and though in the Key there are Eighty new-coyn'd Words, yet not above Six of them are made uſe of in all the parcel of the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi>'s Letters hitherto intercepted.</p>
               <p>However, by the Light theſe Letters gave, ſo well agreeing with ſeveral other Intelligences receiv'd from many Hands, His Majeſties Council of <hi>Scotland</hi> were abundantly convinc'd that the Bloody De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign had reach'd thither alſo; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore immediately order'd the bottom of the Buſineſs to be ſearch'd into by a Secret Committee. Whereupon Warrants were iſſued out there to apprehend <hi>Walter</hi> Earl of <hi>Tarras,</hi> Brother-in-Law to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> Sir <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> Laird of <hi>Polwart, <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> without either cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or receiving any ſecurity for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, did ingenuouſly confeſs,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>That about the time, when Sir <hi>John Cockran,</hi> and Commiſſary <hi>Monroe</hi> got their Commiſſion from the <hi>Carolina</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany for <hi>London,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baillie</hi> deſir'd him to ſpeak to <hi>Monroe,</hi> that he might be added to the Commiſſion: Telling him

                  <p>That thereupon the ſaid <hi>Baillie</hi> did ſettle a Correſpondence with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, whereby the one was to give an account what paſt between the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Party in <hi>England,</hi> and the Scotch Men there; the other to write back what occurr'd in <hi>Scotland.</hi>

                  <p>That the ſaid <hi>Baillie</hi> told him, the only way to ſecure the Proteſtant Religion, was for the King to ſuffer the Parliament to ſit, and paſs the Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion: Which the King might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to do, if the Parliament would take ſharp and brisk Meaſures with him.</p>

                  <p>That the Scotch-Men at <hi>London</hi> had ask'd 30000 Pounds, but that <hi>Argyle</hi> was to have 10000 <hi>l.</hi> which Sum was to be ſent by <hi>Baillie</hi> into <hi>Holland</hi> to buy Arms, and then <hi>Argyle</hi> was to Land with thoſe Arms in the <hi>Weſt-Highlands</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> depoſed farther, That <hi>Philiphaugh</hi> and he went to <hi>Gallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiels</hi> Houſe, where they met with <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wart</hi> and <hi>Gallowſhiels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That there it was diſcours'd among them, that in caſe the Engliſh ſhould riſe in Arms, it was neceſſary ſo many as could be got on the Borders, ſhould be in readineſs to deal with Straglers, and Seize on Horſes, and thereafter joyn with thoſe that were in Arms on the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>England:</hi> That then it would be convenient to ſurprize <hi>Berwick, Stirling,</hi> and ſome other ſtrong places: That ſome Perſons ſhould be employ'd to inquire what Arms were in the Country: That it was reſolv'd every one ſhould ſpeak
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:37494:73"/>to, and prepare ſuch particular Perſons as they could truſt, not at firſt in plain terms, but indirectly, and upon ſuppoſition of a Riſing in <hi>England:</hi> That there was a Word and Sign to be uſed among them, the Sign was by looſing a Button on the Breaſt, the word was <hi>Harmony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That it was agreed among them all, that the beſt time for <hi>Argyle</hi> to Land, was when there ſhould be a Stir in <hi>England. Stir</hi> being the word which theſe Scotch Traytors and the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> uſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs what in plain Engliſh is call'd open Rebellion.</p>
               </q>
               <p>In the like manner Commiſſary <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Monroe</hi> depos'd upon Oath,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>That the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> did propoſe to him, that Mr. <hi>Baillie</hi> might be made one of the Commiſſioners for the Affair of <hi>Carolina.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That he did go along with Mr. <hi>Baillie</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and heard him by the way regretting the hazard, their Laws, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and the Proteſtant Religion were in.</p>
                  <p>That Mr. <hi>Baillie</hi> ſpoke to the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent more than once at <hi>London</hi> for get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Mony from the Engliſh to be ſent to <hi>Argyle,</hi> to bring home Arms for the ſaid
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:37494:73"/>
                     <hi>Argyle</hi>'s uſe to raiſe an Inſurrection in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That in <hi>Baillie</hi>'s Chamber in <hi>London, William Veitch</hi> a Forefault, that is, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Traytor, being preſent, Sir <hi>John Cockran</hi> did expreſly ſpeak of Mony to be ſent to <hi>Argyle</hi> for the foreſaid purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>That on another occaſion he heard ſome of them ſay, there would be 20000 Men in <hi>Scotland</hi> ready to aſſiſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
                  <p>That Mr. <hi>Robert Martin</hi> was ſent down from that Meeting in <hi>Baillie</hi>'s Chamber to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to try what the Scots would do for their own Safety: That is was agreed the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould Riſe, when there was a Riſing in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Commiſſion was granted to <hi>Martin</hi> by all the Perſons preſent, who were the Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> Sir <hi>John Cockran,</hi> the <hi>Ceſſnocks</hi> Elder and Younger, Mr. <hi>William Carſtares,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Veitch, Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſwood,</hi> and the Deponent, who did all contribute Money towards his Journey.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Martin</hi> at his return from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> meeting, with the Deponent, told him, Matters were in ſuch a Condition there, as a little would kindle the Fire in order to a Rebellion.</p>
               </q>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:37494:74"/>
               <p>Then alſo <hi>James Murray</hi> Laird of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liphaugh</hi> confeſs'd, and depoſed upon Oath,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>That in <hi>May</hi> 1683. upon a Letter from Mr. <hi>Pringle</hi> of <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> to invite him to his Houſe, he came, where he found Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> lately come from <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That upon diſcourſe <hi>Martin</hi> told them the City was much irritated through ſome Attempts upon their Privileges; but that all honeſt Men were of good heart, and very brisk.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> then told the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent he expected the Earl of <hi>Tarras,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſent for him, becauſe <hi>Martin</hi> had a Letter directed to him from <hi>Jerviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood: Torwoodlie</hi> adding, That there were great Matters in Agitation at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that <hi>Martin</hi> was come down with a Commiſſion to their Friends here; but he was to Communicate his Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons only to <hi>Polwart</hi> and himſelf, who were to pitch on ſuch Perſons as they thought fit to intruſt with the Affair: That he had great confidence in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, and therefore had ſent to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him, that things were now come to a Criſis: That he had reaſon to think <hi>England</hi> would ſhortly be in Arms: That
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:37494:74"/>it was no Project of an inconſiderable Party, but a Deſign through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: That many of the fineſt Men, and of greateſt Intereſt and Credit were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it there, and had agreed for the advancing Mony to furniſh Arms here: That <hi>Polwart</hi> would be at <hi>Gallowſhiels</hi> that Night, and it would be neceſſary the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> and the Deponent ſhould confer with him fully on the Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>That about this time the Earl of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> came, who retired a little to diſcourſe with <hi>Martin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That then <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> told the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, that although <hi>Martin</hi> would not Commune with them upon his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion directly, yet it would be fit they conferr'd, and without taking notice of his Commiſſion, diſcours'd of things as their own private Notions, abſtracted from any proſpect of a preſent Deſign.</p>
                  <p>That accordingly after Dinner they four retired to a Chamber, and after ſome general talk of the Diſcontents of both Kingdoms, theſe Suppoſitions following were diſcours'd of, <hi>Martin</hi> ſtarting all, or moſt of them.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Country Party in</hi> England <hi>ſhould have thoughts of going into Arms, what
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:37494:75"/>could be expected here in ſuch a caſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Would it not be expedient to have a ſetled Correſpondence between that Party there, and here?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Might it not be ſo adjuſted, that both Kingdoms ſhould draw out in one day?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Might not as many be expected in theſe Shires, and about</hi> Edenburgh, <hi>as would ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the Rulers, and ſome to joyn with the Engliſh on the Borders, and ſeize on</hi> Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, <hi>others to attempt</hi> Stirling-Caſtle?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If</hi> Argyle <hi>ſhould at the ſame time Land in the</hi> Weſt, <hi>and raiſe that Country, would not theſe Meaſures contribute much to the Advancement and Intereſt of the Party? Incourage all that had an Inclination to them, and ſcare many others from acting againſt them? And ſo they might have lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to joyn from all places. And then might it not be expected there would be as many in this Kingdom, as would be able to deal with the Forces here, at leaſt divert them from troubling</hi> England?</p>
               <p>Theſe Queries being propos'd, it was anſwered, <q>That as to ſetling a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence, it was very convenient for thoſe of a Common Intereſt, but none could be found here fit to manage it that would undertake it.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:37494:75"/>
               <q>
                  <p>That as to <hi>tryſting,</hi> that is to ſay, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing at the ſame time, that could not be done without divulging the Deſign to all Ranks of People, which none would conſent to, except thoſe already in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Circumſtances, and they would not generally have much Influence.</p>
                  <p>That the thing was not at all adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for <hi>Scotland,</hi> becauſe if thoſe in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>London,</hi> the Spring of their motions, ſhould happen to have an Interruption near the time appointed, then the Scots not having timely notice, might riſe alone, and ſo be expos'd as a Prey.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Argyle</hi>'s coming was not much to be relied on, by reaſon of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of Sea-Voyages: That he might himſelf be ſuſpected of private Deſigns; that Deſpair might blind his uſual Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and prompt him to indigeſted Methods; ſo it was expected few of the Gentry, but ſuch as were under very hard Circumſtances, would embarque with him. That as to the ſurprizing their Rulers, it was inveigh'd againſt, as an Action not to be thought of amongſt Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>That then <hi>Martin</hi> told the Company, if any had a mind for a ſuit of Armour,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:37494:76"/>he could provide as many as pleas'd, of a new Faſhion, very light, and of an eaſie rate, from one who had made a great many lately for honeſt Men in <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That then all the Company except <hi>Martin,</hi> went to <hi>Gallowſhiels</hi> Houſe, where they met him and <hi>Polwart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That after Supper, having given and received mutual aſſurance that they were free to commune with <hi>Gallowſhiels,</hi> and he with them, touching matters of great Secrecy and Importance, they ſate cloſe together, <hi>Polwart</hi> beginning the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:</p>
                  <p>And ſignifying to them, he was credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly inform'd that the Country Party in <hi>England</hi> would draw into the Fields ſhortly, and as he heard, before <hi>Lammas:</hi> That <hi>Gallowſhiels</hi> ſeem'd viſibly ſurpriz'd at it, ſaying he loved better to be walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his own Parks than to be medling in ſuch matters: However aſſuring them, if there came any troubleſome work, he would joyn with them firmly.</p>
                  <p>That the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> alſo diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of doing any thing during the Kings Life; becauſe that might ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Dukes Intereſt: That therefore he ſuſpected it was a project of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealths-Men,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:37494:76"/>with whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved few Scotch Gentlemen would joyn; and that he was almoſt perſuaded the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in any Riſing during the King's Life.</p>
                  <p>That to all this <hi>Polwart</hi> anſwer'd, He heard the Engliſh had once agreed on that Principle, but it ſeem'd they found they muſt either do their buſineſs now, or lay aſide all hopes of doing it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. For if the Charter of <hi>London</hi> were let fall, they ſhould not only loſe all ſafe Opportunity of digeſting Matters, but alſo a great part of their Strength: Add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he heard all things were concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mutually between <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Friends and the Heads of the Common-Wealth Party; and though <hi>Monmouth</hi> was ſhy on that account, yet he hoped he would engage, or he would be deſerted by that Party.</p>
                  <p>That then <hi>Polwart</hi> mentioned the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Queries, as overtures agreed on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween other Friends in <hi>London,</hi> and the Principal Men of that Party there.</p>
                  <p>That the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> and the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent repeated their former anſwers, <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhiels</hi> joyning forwardly with them.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Polwart</hi> replied, He was fully of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:37494:77"/>their Opinion, if things were entire, but refer'd it to be conſider'd? whether it were not better to comyly with ſome of theſe Methods, though not ſo juſtifiable as could be wiſh'd rather than diſappoint the Buſineſs totally.</p>
                  <p>That there was another Argument urg'd againſt riſing with the Engliſh, becauſe it was talk'd there had been a Day appointed in <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s time, which did not hold; ſo they were not to be relied on.</p>
                  <p>That then it was propoſed to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated what Methods were moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the Companies Opinion for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to follow, in caſe of <hi>Englands</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing firſt.</p>
                  <p>That it was ſaid, All that could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected or deſired from <hi>Scotland</hi> was, that upon certain News of <hi>Englands</hi> being in the Field, thoſe of the Southern Shires ſhould preſently riſe, and as ſoon as ſo many could convene, as would be able to deal with ſtragling Parties, March to joyn the Engliſh on the Borders, that then it would be ſeaſonable for <hi>Argyle</hi> to Land in the Weſt; and theſe Parties on the Borders might divert the Forces, till he had time to put himſelf into a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:37494:77"/>
                  <p>That it was left to <hi>Polwart</hi> to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with others to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>That all the Company ſeem'd to agree, they ſhould move nothing in the Affair, till they had a certain account what <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> propos'd, and who were to be their Heads; that if they deſign'd any thing againſt the Kings Perſon, or for over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Monarchy, they ſhould not be clear to joyn.</p>
                  <p>That it was recommended to all the Company, to be inquiring indirectly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the affections of their Neighbours, and what Arms were amongſt them; that ſo, if they ſhould reſolve to joyn with the Engliſh, they might know where to ſeek the Men and Arms ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly.</p>
                  <p>That here it was ſaid by one, (by <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wart</hi> as the Deponent thinks) That if the Earl of <hi>Tarras, Torwoodlie, Gallowſhiels,</hi> and he took Horſe, moſt part of <hi>Tiviot-Dale</hi> and <hi>Selkirk-Shire</hi> would ſoon come to them, eſpecially when they heard that <hi>England</hi> was riſen.</p>
                  <p>That they all agreed to meet there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at <hi>Midſummer</hi>-Fair, when the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from <hi>England</hi> might be expected; but in caſe it came to any of their hands ſooner, each promis'd to advertiſe the reſt.</p>

               <p>The Deponent farther added, he was told in private by <hi>Polwart</hi> or <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi>

               <q>
                  <p>That <hi>Polwart</hi> kept Correſpondence with their Friends at <hi>London,</hi> naming the Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> Sir <hi>John Cockran, Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſwood,</hi> and Commiſſary <hi>Monroe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Mony to be advanc'd by the Engliſh Party to <hi>Scotland,</hi> was ready when <hi>Martin</hi> left <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That it was expected within few days after, it would be diſpatch'd with ſome Confident to <hi>Holland;</hi> that it was 10000 <hi>l.</hi> and was to be employ'd by that Confident at <hi>Argyle</hi>'s ſight, for buying of Arms, and providing Shipping to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport them with <hi>Argyle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That as ſoon as the Scots at <hi>London</hi> got Notice of their Confidents arrival in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that all other things were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with the Engliſh, which might be about the middle of <hi>June,</hi> then they would come down into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and give them a particular Account of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions taken.</p>
                  <p>That the Deponent was told all Letters were written by both Parties, as about the <hi>Carolina</hi> Buſineſs, or concerning ſome Houſhold-Furniture: That there was a Sign and a Word agreed on, that they might know with whom to uſe freedom;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:37494:78"/>the Word was <hi>Harmony,</hi> and the Sign was the <hi>Opening of Buttons on the Breaſt-Coat, and ſhutting them preſently.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Deponent never ſaw it uſed, except when he viſited <hi>Parkhay</hi> in <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> about the end of <hi>June;</hi> who ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether he had the Word and Sign of the <hi>Carolina</hi>-Men, and the Deponent having given them, ſaid, <hi>He was afraid the</hi> Carolina <hi>Buſineſs did not go well, for there had been ſome of the Managers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected there eight days paſt, but none were come: Nor could he learn any of their Friends had heard from them for ſeveral Poſts.</hi>

               <p>The ſaid <hi>Gallowſhiels</hi> depoſed farther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords of the Committee, <hi>That in the Month of</hi> May 1683. <hi>the Earl of</hi> Tarras, Hume <hi>of</hi> Polwart <hi>the Elder, and the Laird of</hi> Philiphaugh <hi>came to the Deponents Houſe, where they ſpake of the ſecurity of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and of a Party in</hi> England <hi>who would ſecure or ſeize the King or Duke: That if any ſhould riſe in Arms to defend or reſcue them, there was another Party who would riſe againſt them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it was propoſed ſome Country-men ſhould be ſpoken to, to try their Reſolutions: That it was likewiſe propoſed to ſeize the Officers of State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it was there ſaid, Sir</hi> John Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran <hi>was to come to the Weſt from</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>to advance the Deſign: That the Earl of</hi> Argyle <hi>was to Land in the Weſt</hi> High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands <hi>to raiſe that Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That of theſe Matters all that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſcours'd, as of an Affair they were agitating, and wherein themſelves were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly concern'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe ſeveral plain and full Proofs, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Depoſitions of <hi>Carſtares</hi> before mentioned, being alſo ſtrengthen'd
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:37494:80"/>by the Confeſſions of <hi>Thomas Shepard</hi> and <hi>Zechary Bourn,</hi> and all exhibited at the Trial of <hi>William Baillie</hi> of <hi>Jerviſwood,</hi> were not only over-abundantly ſufficient to convince the Perſon accuſed of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſhare in the Guilt; but they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo remain as ſo many ſtanding and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable Teſtimonies of the Truth of the whole Conſpiracy between the Engliſh, and Scotch Rebels.</p>
               <p>After all this, how is it poſſible that the moſt audacious of the Factious Party of both Nations, notwithſtanding their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo expert in driving on the Trade of Lying and traducing their Governours, ſhould ever have any tolerable colour of probability to invalidate or diſcredit the undoubted Evidence of ſo many Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, moſt of them Men of high Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, great Eſtates, potent Intereſts; all of them Zealous and indefatigable Aſſertors of the Rebellious Cauſe; and this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence given in by them at firſt voluntarily, and often again reiterated, and adher'd to, againſt <hi>Baillie</hi> their Chief Companion in Iniquity, their near Kinſman and Friend?</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Baillie</hi> of <hi>Jerviſwood</hi> himſelf, the Perſons who paſs'd upon his Aſſize did with one Voice find the Crimes of Art
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:37494:80"/>and Part in the Conſpiracy, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing and not revealing the ſame, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved againſt him. Whereupon he was adjudg'd to ſuffer the Puniſhment of a Traytor: His Life and Death being ſuch as might be expected from the Nephew and Son-in-Law of the Old Arch Traytor <hi>Warriſton,</hi> in whoſe Family he was bred up, and tutor'd under his Diſcipline, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Principles.</p>
               <p>Such were the chief Steps the Scotch Conſpirators had made in their part of the Treaſonable Deſign, as far as through the Divine Favour it has been hitherto traced out by the Extraordinary Diligence, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Integrity of His Majeſties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Miniſters in that Kingdom. For the Readers clearer comprehending the whole progreſs of the Villany, the King thought beſt to have it thus repreſented in one view, and put all together in an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted courſe of Narration: Though by this Methoddivers things have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken of, which in the natural courſe of time happen'd after the ſeveral material paſſages, that remain yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, relating to the Engliſh part of the Conſpiracy.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, to return to the Year 1683, and to what happen'd in <hi>England</hi> that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:37494:81"/>Summer, ſhortly after the first Diſcovery; His Majeſty having now received irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Proof of the certainty of the Wicked and unnatural Deſign, that the World might have the like Conviction, reſolv'd ſpeedily to bring ſome of the moſt Notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Malefactors to a fair and open Tryal.</p>
               <p>The firſt Perſon who was put upon ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying himſelf, was Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Thomas Walcot,</hi> on the Twelfth of <hi>July</hi> of that Year. Againſt him divers Witneſſes were produced, who, in their Depoſitions, firſt gave ſome diſtinct account of the Plot in General, and then of the particular ſhare the Priſoner at the Bar had in it.</p>
               <p>As to what concerned <hi>Walcot</hi> himſelf, Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> firſt depoſed, <hi>That the ſaid</hi> Walcot <hi>came out of</hi> Holland <hi>with</hi> Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſon <hi>after</hi> Shaftsbury<hi>'s Death: That he came to</hi> Weſt<hi>'s Chamber where he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent when a Liſt was brought of the Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, and agreed to joyn with them, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Command a Party to charge the Guards: That he undertook to go and view</hi> Rumbald<hi>'s Houſe, and bought a Horſe for that purpoſe: That he was preſent at the dividing of</hi> London <hi>into twenty parts in order to an Inſurrection; and at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult for buying of Arms after the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the</hi> Rye: <hi>That he was at the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:37494:81"/>for carrying on the Conſpiracy on</hi> Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day <hi>before the Diſcovery: That after it they met at Captain</hi> Tracies, Walcot's <hi>own Lodgings, himſelf being preſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next <hi>Joſiah Keeling</hi> ſwore, <hi>That</hi> Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot <hi>was at the Trayterous Aſſembly at the</hi> Salutation-Tavern, <hi>when the Deponent was called</hi> Gulick, <hi>and a Health drunk to the Engliſh</hi> Gulick; Weſt <hi>ſaying that</hi> Gulick <hi>in Dutch was</hi> Keeling <hi>in Engliſh; adding,</hi> He hoped to ſee <hi>Keeling</hi> at the Head of as good an Army at <hi>Wapping,</hi> as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported one <hi>Gulick</hi> was then at <hi>Cologne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Zechary Bourn</hi> witneſſed, <hi>That</hi> Walcot <hi>uſed to come to</hi> Ferguſon <hi>when he lodg'd at his Houſe: That</hi> Walcot <hi>and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others met at the</hi> Dragon <hi>on</hi> Snow-Hill, <hi>and often in other places, in order to raiſe Men, and divide the City into twenty parts for ſecuring the King and the Duke: That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every time they met, at leaſt three times, the Priſoner at the Bar was there: That he was at the Meeting at</hi> Tracies, <hi>where they debated of</hi> ſtanding to it with Swords in their Hands, and of kiliing <hi>Keeling</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made the Diſcovery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert Weſt</hi>'s Teſtimony concerring him went ſomewhat farther back. He depoſed, <hi>That he became acquainted with</hi> Walcot <hi>the Summer before, when he told
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:37494:82"/>the Deponent the</hi> Carolina <hi>Buſineſs was only a Pretence; That he ask'd the Deponent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Election of the Sheriffs,</hi> Will the People do nothing to ſecure themſelves? <hi>Thereupon acquainting him with an Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection then deſign'd within three weeks or a month: That</hi> Shaftsbury <hi>was in the Deſign, and had engaged him alſo: That he had an Expectation of being Colonel of Horſe; ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid</hi> Weſt, Whether he would have any Command under him? <hi>That upon his refuſal, he deſired him to lend him a Suit of Silk Armour: That the ſaid</hi> Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot <hi>told him of ſeveral Deſigns to Attack the King and the Duke: That in the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the</hi> Rye, <hi>he undertook to Command the Party that was to ſet upon the Guards: That after the Diſappointment, he met with the other Conſpirators, where they diſcours'd of it, and complain'd they had not Arms in readineſs: That he ſometimes made one in the Trayterous Diſcourſes at the Deponents, and at the</hi> Young-Devil-Tavern: <hi>That he was preſent at the Meeting at</hi> Trades <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to their eſcape; the Priſoner at the Bar himſelf then ſaying,</hi> God would ſtill deliver the Nations.</p>
               <p>His Letter to Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins</hi> was alſo produced, which he was proved to have own'd before the Council to be
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:37494:82"/>his Hand. The ſubſtance of it being, <hi>That he was come to Town to lay himſelf at His Majeſties Feet: That this was the firſt Crime he had been Guilty of ſince the Kings Return, and too ſoon by much now: That he was ready to diſcover to His Majeſty all that he knew in</hi> England, Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>which might be ſomething more than the firſt Diſcoverer could acquaint him with, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as to</hi> Ireland: <hi>That his intimacy with a Scotch Miniſter, through whoſe Hands much of the Buſineſs paſs'd, occaſioned his knowing very much; and that it was laid very broad, or he was miſ-inform'd; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding with a propoſal that he would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Traytors who were fled, and give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice what Meaſures they ſhould take; with other the like expreſſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was likewiſe a Paper given in Evidence that was taken about him in <hi>Newgate;</hi> wherein he deſir'd <hi>Romzey</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> to ſpare him, ſaying, <hi>They had ground enough to ſerve the King upon other Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as to his private Confeſſion to the King upon his firſt Examination, that was not produc'd againſt him, though in that he had told divers new Particulars of the Conſpiracy, and named the Men of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity who had undertaken to raiſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Shires.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:37494:83"/>
               <p>Againſt all this <hi>Walcot</hi>'s defence only conſiſted in his own denial of having had any Hand in the Aſſaſſination; ſaying, <q>He knew well enough, if he ſhould have undertaken to charge the Guards whilſt others kill'd the King, he was equally Guilty with thoſe that kill'd him; but that he was ſick of the Gout during the Meetings whilſt the King was at <hi>New-market:</hi> Moreover, that thoſe Witneſſes were ſufficiently dipped themſelves, and ſwore againſt him to ſave their own Lives: That <hi>Goodenough</hi> and <hi>Rumbald</hi> he never knew: That the laſt Meeting at his Lodgings was appointed by <hi>Rom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zey,</hi> he himſelf knowing nothing of it: That he came accidentally to the other Meetings only to hear News. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed he heard there was a Deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt divers great Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for aſſerting Liberties and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but that he was not at their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations. The Sum was, That he had heard a great deal of an Inſurrection, but had no hand in it, and therefore his fault could be only Miſpriſion of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And as to his Letter, he alledged he had only heard what he promiſed to diſcover from <hi>Ferguſon.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To the moſt material parts of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:37494:83"/>it was anſwer'd by His Majeſties Learned Council at Law, <q>That there is nothing more juſt than to make uſe of ſome Traytors to Convict others, elſe Treaſon might be hatch'd moſt ſecurely: That becauſe the Witneſſes had been concern'd in the Plot, therefore they were to be believed; for who ſhould know it but thoſe that were concern'd? That better Witneſſes could not have been had, except the thing had ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: That the very being at Treaſonable Conſults, and keeping them private, is not only Miſpriſion, but High Treaſon. And as to his having the Gout, <hi>Weſt</hi> told him, he remember'd it very well by a good token, that <hi>Walcot</hi> himſelf ſaid, <hi>He was afraid when the time came, he ſhould not be able to draw on his Boot.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But the whole Evidence againſt <hi>Walcot</hi> being clear and poſitive Teſtimony, and what he pleaded for himſelf being only his own ſingle Affirmation and Negation, without any ſupport of Witneſſes, the Jury immediately brought him in guilty of High Treaſon. According to which Sentence he was Executed on the 20th of the ſaid Month. At the time of his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution he again acknowled'g what he had told the King, and writ to the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:37494:84"/>of State, <q>That the Buſineſs was laid very deep; he ſaid, An Act of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence would do well, becauſe the King had a great many Men to take Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of: He perſiſted, he was to have had no hand in His Majeſties Death, though he confeſs'd it was propoſed when he was preſent: He declared he did not know that this Conſpiracy was older than the <hi>August</hi> or <hi>September</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: but ſo old he own'd it was.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The next Offender that came under the Stroak of Juſtice, was <hi>william Hone</hi> a Joyner, who being brought to the Bar, would preſently have confeſs'd himſelf guilty of great part of the Accuſation. But refuſing to confeſs all, he was requir'd to plead, and the next day was brought on his Tryal. Then again he deſir'd he might retract his Plea, and offer'd to plead Guilty. But ſince he would not own the whole Indictment, for Satisfaction of the World the Evidence againſt him was produc'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſiah Keeling</hi> ſwore, <hi>That the Priſoner at the Bar was at the</hi> Dolphin-Tavern, <hi>when ſeveral ſorts of Arms were agreed on to be provided under the borrow'd Names of</hi> Swan-Quills, Gooſe-Quills, Crow-Quills: <hi>That after that Meeting,</hi> Hone
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:37494:84"/>
                  <hi>told the Deponent, He was to be one of them who were to go down to the</hi> Rye <hi>to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinate the King. That he ſince alſo told him, It would never be well till the</hi> Black-Bird <hi>and the</hi> Gold-Finch <hi>were knock'd on the Head; explaining thoſe terms to be meant of the King and the Duke.</hi> To which Witneſs <hi>Hone</hi> reply'd in open Court, <hi>That as to the</hi> Black-Bird <hi>he own'd it, but not as to the</hi> Gold-Finch.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Weſt</hi> Depoſed, <hi>That</hi> Goodenough <hi>having told him he would try</hi> Hone, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would attempt on the Duke without the King, the Deponent ask'd</hi> Hone, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had ſeen</hi> Goodenough? <hi>He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, He had, and that he had ſpoken to him about a job for the Duke. That at another time alſo</hi> Hone <hi>ask'd the Deponent,</hi> Maſter, ſhall we do nothing? <hi>Adding,</hi> That if the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would be true, and appear, he would bring 50 or 60 Men from the other ſide of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to help to do the Buſineſs. <hi>And that the Deponent demanding what Buſineſs? He anſwer'd,</hi> A brisk Puſh at the two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>That being further queſtion'd, What Brothers? He ſaid,</hi> The Captain and Lieutenant; <hi>which were the counterfeit Names they ſometimes uſed for the King and the Duke.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:37494:85"/>
               <p>Then Sir <hi>Nicholas Butler</hi> depoſed, <hi>He had known</hi> Hone <hi>many years, and always knew him guilty of plotting, contriving, and ready for ſuch Enterpriſes as this: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that he had propoſed taking off the King and the Duke with Croſs-Bows from</hi> Bow-Steeple, <hi>whilſt they were ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Houſe directly over againſt it on the Lord Mayors Day: That</hi> Hone <hi>confeſs'd this very thing when examined before His Majeſty: That he had alſo acquainted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Perſons, that he was to make one to kill the King and the Duke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> ſwore, <hi>That the Priſoner confeſs'd to Sir</hi> Nicholas But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, <hi>in his preſence, that</hi> Goodenough <hi>came to him and told him, he wanted Labourers; That</hi> Hone <hi>asking him for what?</hi> Goode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough <hi>ſaid it was to kill the King, and the Duke: That he did agree to be one of the Number: That</hi> Hone <hi>did ſay another time, he was for killing the King, and ſaving the Duke; but that</hi> Goodenough <hi>was for both: That he told them of the buſineſs of the</hi> Rye, <hi>calling it the place where the King was to have been Murder'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all this <hi>Hone</hi> made no other anſwer, but that he was drawn in by <hi>Goodenough;</hi> and as for killing the King from <hi>Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeple,</hi> he was told of it by another. So
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:37494:85"/>the Jury found him Guilty without going out of the Court.</p>
               <p>At his Execution, he own'd himſelf Guilty of the Crime, for which he ſtood condemn'd. Only alledging again, that he was drawn in. He confeſs'd alſo, he did ſay he was for killing the King, and ſaving the Duke of <hi>York.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On which laſt expreſſion the Factious party immediately laid hold. And they have ſince moſt impudently made uſe of it, in their Libels both at home and abroad, to take the aſperſion of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, off from themſelves, inſinuating that this ſaying of <hi>Hone</hi>'s (a Notorious Fanatick) muſt needs prove him to have been a conceal'd Papiſt. Whereas it is apparent, he ſaid it upon a quite different account: Since it was a common opinion among them, that if they could but do the Kings Buſineſs, their work againſt the Duke would be much eaſier: A Leſſon firſt taught them by their great Maſter the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> For when in one of their Trayterous Cabals, among other Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of time and place, for killing the Royal Brothers, that between <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> and <hi>Windſor</hi> was propoſed, and ſome excepted againſt it, becauſe his Majeſty and his Royal Highneſs ſeldom went that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:37494:86"/>way together; the ſaid Earl adviſed them not to ſtand upon that, and not to omit the opportunity of making the King away for any ſuch Objection; giving this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reaſon for his advice, <hi>That if the King were once diſpatched, they ſhould eaſily be able to deal with the Duke of</hi> York; grounding his Judgment on a moſt falſe Suppoſition, That the People were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally averſe from his Royal Highneſs.</p>
               <p>The next Criminal arraign'd was <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> who was brought to his Tryal <hi>July</hi> the 13th of that year.</p>
               <p>Againſt him Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> depoſed, <q>That in the end of <hi>October,</hi> or the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>November</hi> 1683. there met at Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Abchurch-Lane,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> and <hi>Ferguſon:</hi> That the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to go to them thither, to know what reſolution was taken about the Riſing of <hi>Taunton:</hi> That he did go, Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> carried him up where they were, and he deliver'd his Meſſage. That the Anſwer was, <hi>Mr.</hi> Trenchard <hi>had fail'd them; and there could be no more done in the matter at that time:</hi> That there was at the ſame time a diſcourſe by all the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:37494:86"/>Company about ſeeing what poſture the Guards were in, that they might know how to ſurprize them; That ſome of them undertook to go and ſee: That my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> in particular did ſpeak about the Riſing, and gave his conſent to it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> ſwore, <q>That in <hi>October</hi> laſt, <hi>Ferguſon</hi> requeſted of him, in the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Name, the conveniency of his Houſe, for ſome Perſons of Quality to meet in; That the ſame Day in the Evening the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ruſſel, Armſtrong</hi> and <hi>Ferguſon</hi> came: That they deſir'd to be private, and none of his Servants to come up: That their diſcourſe was, How to ſurprize the Guards: That the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and <hi>Armſtrong</hi> went one Night to the <hi>Mews</hi> to view them: That the next time they came, <hi>Armſtrong</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Guards were remiſs, and the thing was feaſible:</hi> That they had two Meetings of this kind at his Houſe; That in one of them ſomething was read by <hi>Ferguſon</hi> in the nature of a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſetting forth the Grievances of the Nation in order to a Riſing: That he could not ſay poſitively the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was there when it was read; but the ſaid
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:37494:87"/>Lord was there, when they talk'd of ſeizing the Guards.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Eſcrick</hi> gave his Depoſition, conſiſting of two parts, a general Declaration of what he knew of the whole Conſpiracy, and his particular Evidence touching the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s being engaged in it.</p>
               <p>In the general part, his Teſtimony was agreeable to what has been already cited out of his Confeſſion to his Majesty; only in ſome paſſages he was more particular as to Perſons, eſpecially concerning Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Colonel <hi>Walcot,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> as appears by the Printed Tryal.</p>
               <p>But what peculiarly related to the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was to this effect; That after the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Flight, the chief Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concern'd in the Conſpiracy in his time, began to conſider they had gone ſo far it would be unſafe for them to make a retreat; and that ſo great an Affair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſo many Particulars, which were to be manag'd with ſo much fineneſs, it would be neceſſary to have ſome General Council: That therefore they reſolv'd to erect a Cabal among themſelves, which was made up of ſix Perſons, the Duke of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:37494:87"/>
                  <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Colonel <hi>Algernoon Sydney,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> Junior, and the Deponent: That this was about the middle of the <hi>January</hi> before: That then they met at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s Houſe, where it was preſently agreed, their proper Province was to take care of the whole: That the chief things they debated were, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Inſurrection ſhould begin firſt in <hi>London</hi> or the Country; the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> inſiſting, it ſhould be firſt in the Country; then what Countries and Towns were fitteſt, and moſt ready for Action; then, what Arms were to be got, and how to be diſpoſed; then that it was neceſſary to have a common Bank of 25 or 30000 <hi>l.</hi> to anſwer the occaſions of ſuch an Undertaking; but that the greateſt point was to order it ſo, as to draw <hi>Scotland</hi> into a conſent with them; becauſe it was requiſite all diverſion ſhould be given to the Kings Forces.</p>
               <p>That about Ten Days after every one of the ſame perſons met again at the Lord <hi>Ruſſel's</hi> Houſe: That they then came to a reſolution of ſending ſome Perſons to the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> to ſettle an Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, and that a Meſſenger ſhould be diſpatch'd into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:37494:88"/>ſome Scotch-Men hither, who beſt underſtood the Eſtare of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to give an account of it: That the Perſons agreed on to be ſent for were Sir <hi>John Cockran,</hi> the Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> and one of the Name of <hi>Cambel:</hi> That to this purpoſe it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, a Perſon ſhould be thought on that was to be ſent: That Colonel <hi>Sydney</hi> was intruſted to take care of that Buſineſs: That the ſaid Colonel told the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, he had ſent <hi>Aaron Smith:</hi> That then they agreed not to meet again till the return of the Meſſenger; who was gone about a Month before they heard any thing of him; though the Letter he carried, could have done no great hurt, had it been taken, becauſe it was written in a kind of a Cant, under the diſguiſe of a Plantation in <hi>Carolina:</hi> That all this Debate at the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s went without contradiction, all there preſent giving their conſent: That as for raiſing Mony, every one was put to think of ſuch a way, that Mony might be collected without Adminiſtring Jealouſie: That after this the Deponent met no more with them; but when he return'd out of the Country, he was inform'd <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> was come back, and that Sir <hi>John Cockran</hi> Was alſo come to Town.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:37494:88"/>
               <p>Then <hi>Attherbury</hi> the Kings Meſſenger depoſed, <q>That the foreſaid <hi>Cambel</hi> and his Son were taken in <hi>London,</hi> making their eſcape out of a Window in a Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers Houſe, four Days after they had been in Town; during which ſpace, they confeſs'd they had chang'd their Lodgings three Times, and that they and Mr. <hi>Baillie</hi> of <hi>Jerviſwood</hi> came to Town together.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt this Evidence the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s defence (beſides ſome Objections in point of Law, wherein he was over-ruled by the Opinion of all the Judges there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) was to this purpoſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the two times they met, was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no form'd Deſign, only to talk of News, and of things in general: That the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> having a voluble Tongue, they delighted to hear him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: That he knew of no ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Six choſen, for who ſhould chuſe them? That the Witneſſes againſt him ſwore to ſave their own Lives, and therefore could not be credible: That <hi>Romzey</hi> was notoriouſly known to have been highly obliged by the King and the Duke; and it was ſtrange he ſhould be capable of ſuch a Deſign as to Murder the King; that no Body then could won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:37494:89"/>if to ſave his own Life, he ſhould endeavour to take away anothers: That the time by the 13th of the King was clapſed, ſince the Proſecution was not made in the ſix Months: That a Deſign of Levying War is no Treaſon, except it appear by ſome Overt Act: That there was but one Meeting at <hi>Shepara</hi>'s Houſe, nor was he ever there but once: That then he came late, ſtaid not above a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour, taſting Sherry with <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard;</hi> and that there ought to be two Witneſſes to one and the ſame thing at the ſame time.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then he produced Witneſſes to prove that the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> before he was taken, declar'd <hi>He believ'd the Lord</hi> Ruſſel <hi>innocent, and knew nothing againſt him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reſt of his Juſtification conſiſted of the Teſtimony of ſeveral Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Virtue and Sobriety of his former Life.</p>
               <p>As to what concern'd the Lord <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>He believed the Lord</hi> Ruſſel <hi>not to be guilty;</hi> it was anſwer'd by the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> himſelf, <q>That he confeſs'd he had ſaid ſo, being then himſelf not accuſed, ſo that he intended to out-face the thing both for himſelf and the Party;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:37494:89"/>but now his Duty to God, the King and his Country requir'd it, he muſt ſay the Truth; and that though the Council of Six were not choſen by any Community, yet they did erect themſelves by mutual Agreement one with another into that Society.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The reſt was anſwer'd by the Kings Learned Council at Law, <q>That he was not Try'd upon the 13th of the King, but upon the 25th of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third: That to Raiſe a Conſpiracy within the Kingdom is what is call'd Levying War by that Statute: That to Deſign to ſeize on the King, or to depoſe him, or to raiſe the Subjects againſt him, hath been ſetled by ſeveral Reſolutions of the Judges to be within that Statute, and Evidences of a Deſign to kill the King: That in Caſes of Treaſon, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary there ſhould be two Witneſſes to the ſame individual Fact, at the ſame time; but if there he two Witneſſes of things tending to the ſame Fact, though at ſeveral times, and upon ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, it is ſufficient: That if there be one Witneſs of one Act of Treaſon, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of a ſecond, another of a third, they will be enough to Convicta Man of High Treaſon: That ſo it was determin'd
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:37494:90"/>by the Opinion of all the Judges in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and by the Lords in Parliament in the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Caſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was farther urged, <q>That the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> were not profligate Perſons, nor Men who wanted Faith and Credit before that time; but ſuch againſt whom there had been no legal Exceptions made by himſelf: That there was no Contradiction, no Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence or Contrivance at all between them; and that it cannot be imagined ſuch Men ſhould Damn their own Souls to take away the Life of a Gentleman, againſt whom they had no Quarrel.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Romzey</hi>'s being much obliged to the King and the Duke, <q>That it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent by many Inſtances, that no ſuch, though the greateſt Obligations, had hinder'd ill Men from Conſpiring againſt His Majeſty. For was not the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> were not divers others of the Conſpirators in like manner obliged, and advanced in Eſtate and Honour by the King?</q>
               </p>
               <p>As to their coming only to <hi>Shepard</hi>'s to taſte Wine, it was ſaid, <q>That could not have been the end of their Meeting: Why did they then come ſo privately? Why then did they order none of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:37494:90"/>Servants to come up? It was plain the Deſign they met on, requir'd only ſuch Perſons to be preſent as had an Affection for the Cauſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was alſo urg'd, <q>That it is not a good Objection againſt a Mans being Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in High Treaſon, that he himſelf was engaged in it; but that ſuch Men are the moſt proper Perſons to be Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, none but they being able to detect ſuch Counſels.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As for the ſeveral Divines, and Men of Honour and Quality produced to teſtifie the Virtue and Sobriety of the Lord <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi>'s Converſation; it was anſwer'd, <q>That an Affectation of Popularity has often proved a Snare ſtrong enough to tempt many Men, who have otherwiſe been of great Temperance and Virtue. Nor indeed can there be any more dangerous Enemies to a State or Kingdom, than ſuch as come ſober to endeavour its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</q> Which old and true Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was ſignally exemplified in this particular Caſe of the Lord <hi>Ruſſel;</hi> For <hi>Weſt</hi> depoſed, <q>That the Underacters in the Treaſon moſt depended on the ſaid Lord, for this very reaſon, becauſe they look'd on him as a Man of great Sobriety.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:37494:91"/>
               <p>Upon the whole Proceſs he was found guilty of High Treaſon. But in ſtead of Drawing, Hanging and Quartering, the uſual and legal Penalty of that Crime, the Execution was by His Majeſties Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency chang'd into that of Beheading. Though it is well known, this very Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of the <hi>Kings</hi> having it in his Power to alter the Puniſhment of High Treaſon, had been vehemently diſputed by the Party, and particularly by the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> himſelf in the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> at the time of his Death, which was the 21ſt of that Month, deliver'd a Paper to the Sheriffs, and left other Copies of it with his Friends, whereby it was immediately diſpers'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the People; the general drift of it being to make odious Inſinuations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Government, invidious Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on the Miniſters of His Majeſties Juſtice, and undue Extenuations of his own Fault.</p>
               <p>As to the whole Matter of it, Time, the beſt Diſcoverer, and Light of Truth, has ſince ſhewn it to be full of Enormous Falſhoods: And for the manner of its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, it was ſuch, as rather became the Subtilty, Artifice and Equivocation
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:37494:91"/>of ſome crafty hypocritical Confeſſor, or Presbyterian Caſuiſt, than the Noble plainneſs and ſimplicity of a Gentleman; eſpecially of One who in this very Paper ſo much boaſts of the Sincerity and Candour of his whole Life, and of his perpetual hatred of Tricks and Evaſions.</p>
               <p>Among divers other notorious Shifts and Prevarications contain'd in it, this is obſervable, That in this Paper he declares ſolemnly he never was at <hi>Shepard</hi>'s in that Company but once, as in his Tryal he had affirm'd abſolutely he never was there but once: whereas, beſides what <hi>Shepard</hi> poſitively ſwore, <hi>That he was more than once there, and in that very Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> the ſaid Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> himſelf alſo, when he was Examin'd in the <hi>Tower</hi> by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Command <hi>June</hi> 28th, confeſs'd, <hi>He had been at</hi> Shepard<hi>'s Houſe frequently;</hi> which Confeſſion after it was written down, read and repeated by himſelf, he in great Agitation of Mind deſir'd he might alter it. And the Alteration he made was to put in <hi>divers times</hi> in ſtead of <hi>frequently.</hi> The Truth of which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Original thus ſubſcribed, and corrected by the Lord <hi>Ruſſel;</hi> and by the known Integrity of Sir <hi>Leolyn Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> Sir <hi>Jon Ernly,</hi> and His Majeſties
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:37494:92"/>Attorney-General and Sollicitor-General, who receiv'd the Examination, and have atteſted the Alteration.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> likwiſe in the Printed Speech affirms, <hi>His intention of going to</hi> Shepards <hi>was to taſte Sherry;</hi> and in his Tryal he ſaid, <hi>He ſtaid not above a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Hour there taſting of Sherry.</hi> Though preſently after in the very ſame Paper, forgetting what he had ſaid, he acknowledges, <hi>He was deſir'd to go thither by the Duke of</hi> Monmouth, <hi>upon a buſineſs of greater conſequence than the taſting of Sherry:</hi> Which was, <hi>That the Duke of</hi> Monmouth <hi>call'd upon him to tell him, that the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury <hi>and ſome other hot Men would undo them all, if great care were not taken; and therefore intreated him to go with him to</hi> Shepards. To this he adds, <hi>That when he came thither, there were things ſpoken by ſome with much more heat than Judgment;</hi> Things of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, no doubt, with thoſe he confeſs'd to have heard before in the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>'s Company, which made the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> himſelf cry out, <hi>Did you ever hear ſo Horrid a thing?</hi> However all theſe Treaſonable Diſcourſes about making ſome <hi>Stirs</hi> as he ſtiles them, the ſaid Lord would fain have had paſs only for Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſion
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:37494:92"/>of Treaſon. Though it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that in all thoſe his laſt Words, there is no more ſign of his asking Forgiveneſs of God or the King, for his confeſs'd Miſpriſion, than for the High Treaſon. Moreover in the ſame printed Paper he ſolemnly avows, <hi>There was no undertaking at</hi> Shepards <hi>for ſeizing the Guards; none appointed to view or examine them; only that there was ſome diſcourſe then, and at other times, about the feaſibleneſs of it;</hi> adding, <hi>That ſeveral times by accident he heard it mention'd, as a thing might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be done.</hi> By which and other the like conceſſions in that Speech he well nigh grants himſelf Guilty of the Crime whereof he was accus'd; ſince the Judges often affur'd him, that thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes and Conſultations not revealed are High Treaſon.</p>
               <p>He farther ſays, <hi>it was by a ſtrange fetch, that a design of ſeizing on the Guards was conſtrued a design of killing the King.</hi> But that this conſtruction was no ſuch ſtrange fetch, Colonel <hi>Walcot</hi> himſelf might have inform'd him; who both at his Trial, and his Execution, did with far more Truth and Ingenuity allow, <hi>that it was the ſame thing for him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Kings Guards, whilſt another
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:37494:93"/>kill'd him, as to kill him with his own Hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though, to put this whole Matter out of queſtion, touching that Conſultation at <hi>Shepards,</hi> for ſeizing the Guards, His Majeſty declares on the Faith of a King, appealing alſo to the Memory of his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Highneſs to confirm the ſame, That the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> did, in expreſs Terms confeſs this very particular, and all the Circumſtances of it to His Majeſty at the time of his rendring himſelf: Namely, <hi>That the foreſaid debate of ſurprizing the Guards was at</hi> Shepards; <hi>that the Lord</hi> Ruſſel <hi>was one of the Perſons debating it; that the reſult was, the Duke of</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, <hi>the Lord Gray, and Sir</hi> Thomas Armſtrong <hi>ſhould go view the Guards in order to ſeize them; that accordingly they three did go, and take a view of them to that end; and that the report they made to the ſame Company at their next Meeting was, that the thing might be done, if they had any conſiderable ſtrength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what need any farther Proof of the inſincerity of the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s laſt Juſtification, than the foremention'd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Carſtares?</hi> An Evidence not only by Law unqueſtionable, but ſuch as cannot but be eſteem'd by the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:37494:93"/>themſelves of invincible ſtrength and conviction: Since he was a Man emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in their Party, and one of their principal ſeducing Teachers. And what the ſaid <hi>Carſtares</hi> depoſed relating to the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> His Majeſty thinks fit to be repeated here again. It was, <hi>That when he return'd into</hi> England <hi>out of</hi> Holland, <hi>where he had been to concert matters with the Earl of</hi> Argyle, <hi>for promoting the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Conſpiracy; the next Day he met with Sir</hi> John Cockran, <hi>and having acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with the Earl of</hi> Argyl<hi>'s demands of</hi> 30000 <hi>l.</hi>
                  <hi>Sterling, and the Thouſand Horſe and Dragoons, Sir</hi> John Cockran <hi>carried the ſaid</hi> Carſtares <hi>to the Lord</hi> Ruſſel; <hi>to whom he propoſed the affair, but being then a perfect ſtranger, had noreturn from him at that time. That afterwards the Deponent met with the Lord</hi> Ruſſel <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally at</hi> Shepard<hi>'s Houſe, where, as</hi> Shepard <hi>affirm'd, the ſaid Lord was come to ſpeak with him about the Money before-mention'd. That when the other two had done talking,</hi> Carſtares <hi>himſelf deſi'd to ſpeak with the Lord</hi> Ruſſel; <hi>and that in his diſcourſe with him, having reiterated the former propoſition for the</hi> 30000 <hi>l.</hi>
                  <hi>and the Thouſand Horſe, and Dragoons, the Lord</hi> Ruſſel <hi>anſwer'd in theſe very Words;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:37494:94"/>They could not get ſo much Mony rais'd at the time, but if they had</hi> 1000 <hi>l.</hi>
                  <hi>to begin, that would draw People in, and when they were once in, they would ſoon be brought to wore. But as for the 1000 Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, he could ſay nothing at the preſent, for that behoved to be concerted on the Borders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which plain Depoſition, agreeing with ſo many other Witneſſes, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that when they whom the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> truſted with Compoſing his laſt Speech, permitted him to affirm on the word of a Dying Man, He <hi>knew nothing of any Deſign against the King or Kingdom,</hi> either they did groſly prevaricate with him, or he with them.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty has judg'd it convenient that the wholes Proceeding with the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> ſhould be thus particularly recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, as well that one great Inſtance for all might be given of the Impartiality and fair courſe in which the publick Juſtice was adminiſter'd againſt the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as alſo that it might appear with what weak Cavils, Ambiguities and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giverſations they defended themſelves both living and dying. For the others who were afterwards brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign Puniſhment, it will not be ſo need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:37494:94"/>to deſcend into every minute part of their Tryals, Condemnations and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which have been already faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully publiſhed; eſpecially ſince thoſe that followed made moſt of the ſame Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections in Law and Fact as were before moſt ſolidly anſwer'd. It will be enough only to make ſome few Obſervations, where any new Matter ſhall ariſe, for the fuller Demonſtration of the wicked Deſign.</p>
               <p>On <hi>July</hi> the 13th of that Year, was <hi>John Rouſe</hi> brought to Tryal. Againſt him there was ample Evidence given: Firſt by <hi>Thomas Lea;</hi> 
                  <q>That the ſaid <hi>Rouſe</hi> undertook to provide 100 Arms for the City-Diviſions: That he ſaid, <hi>Nothing could be done unleſs the King were ſeiz'd;</hi> adding, <hi>We remember Forty One, when the King went and ſet up his Standard; therefore we will ſeize them that they ſhall not ſet up their Standard.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That he farther ſaid, It would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to have a Ball plaid on <hi>Black-Heath;</hi> to that end ſome Sea-Captains muſt be ſpoken to, he promiſing to ſpeak to Ten: That when the Ball ſhould be won, every Captain might take his Party, and tell them they had other
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:37494:95"/>Work, and then go with long Boats and Arms to ſeize the <hi>Tower:</hi> That the ſaid <hi>Rouſe</hi> had ſeveral ſuch Diſcourſes, and went divers times to view the <hi>Tower</hi> to that end: That after the Diſcovery he ſaid to <hi>Goodenough</hi> and <hi>Nelthrop, Be not diſcourag'd, but let the Buſineſs go on:</hi> That he ſaid, <hi>Take off the King and the Duke, and then no Man can have Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to fight for them:</hi> That he alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, <hi>He was under an Oath of Secrecy, never to truſt but one at a time with the Design.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then by <hi>William Leigh,</hi> 
                  <q>That the ſaid <hi>Rouſe</hi> farther endeavour'd to get Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to ſeize on, and Command ſome of the Kings Ships, lying as Guard-Ships at <hi>Woolwich</hi> and <hi>Deptford:</hi> That being ask'd, <hi>What he would do with Ships without Powder and Shot, with which they could not be provided except the</hi> Tower <hi>were ſurpriz'd?</hi> He reply'd, We <hi>muſt ſecure the</hi> Tower <hi>and</hi> Whitehal, <hi>both, or ;we can do nothing.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And farther, to prove the ſaid. <hi>Rouſe</hi>'s former Trayterous Tempter of Mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt His Majeſties Government, it was ſworn by Mr. <hi>Corbin,</hi> 
                  <q>That upon ſome diſcourſe concerning the Parliament at <hi>Oxford Rouſe</hi> ſaid, <hi>He foreſaw it would
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:37494:95"/>be a ſhort Seſſions, but that theſe frequent Prorogations and Diſſolutions of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would not avail him: For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the King has, the Parliament gave him, and they may take it away when they pleaſe: That the King had for forfeited his Crown, and had no more Right to it than he had.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt this all the Defence <hi>Rouſe</hi> made was, <q>That the words atteſted by <hi>Corbin,</hi> were ſpoken upon a Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Popes Power over Princes: That as for <hi>William Lea</hi> he had nothing to ſay againſt him, but hoped he was an honeſt Man; and for <hi>Thomas Lea,</hi> that the ſaid <hi>Lea</hi> himſelf firſt began thoſe Treaſonable Diſcourſes, which <hi>Rouſe</hi> intended to have revealed, had not the other got the ſtart of him.</q> But this being only ſupported by his ſingle Yea-and Nay, without the Credit of any one Witneſs to ſtrengthen it, the Jury pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently gave their Verdict that he was Guilty.</p>
               <p>For divers Years before he had been a moſt Notorious <hi>Boutefeu</hi> in the City of <hi>London;</hi> and was one of the many ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Examples of the groſs Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Iniquity of the <hi>Ignoramus</hi>-Juries of that time; he having been unjuſtly
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:37494:96"/>acquitted by them, when in the Year 1681, he was Indicted of high Crimes, particularly for thoſe Trayterous Words mentioned in <hi>Corbin</hi>'s Evidence.</p>
               <p>But at lad the Divine Vengeance over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took him in this manner: <q>At his Death among other things he ingenuouſly confeſs'd, he had deſerved the Sentence paſs'd againſt him; that he had heard and underſtood too much in ſeveral kinds of Meetings, eſpecially of ſome, who though they call'd themſelves True Proteſtants, were Ten Thouſands times worſe than any others.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On <hi>November</hi> the 7th of the ſaid Year 1683, was Colonel <hi>Algernoon Sydney</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd, having ſued out his <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus;</hi> and on the 21ſt he was brought to his Tryal. He was Indicted <q>for being one of their Great Council of Six; for ſending <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> into <hi>Scotland;</hi> and for writing a moſt Treaſonable Libel againſt the Government, which was found in his Cloſet on the Table, when his Papers were ſeiz'd.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As to the ſaid Colonels having been one of their Council of Six, and preſent at, and conſenting to all their Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s and the Lord
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:37494:96"/>
                  <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> depoſed to the ſame ſenſe as he had done at the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Tryal; adding now one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which more eſpecially affected Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Sydney;</hi> 
                  <q>That the ſaid Colonel, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and the Deponent were the firſt Movers of erecting that Council, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to incline the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> to it, and Mr. <hi>Sydney</hi> promiſing for the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hambden.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the Second Article, <q>His ſending <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> into <hi>Scotland</hi> to invite ſome Scotch-Men hither, the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> farther witneſs'd, 'That at their firſt Meeting at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s, amongſt other Matters, it was chiefly debated how to make a coalition of Councils between them and <hi>Scotland;</hi> That to this purpoſe it was propos'd ſome fit Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be thought on to ſend thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to unite them and the Engliſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators into one ſenſe and care: That this was diſcours'd of at the firſt Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That at the next, which was at my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Houſe, every one of the ſame Perſons being preſent, they fell to Conſult of what they had charg'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the time before, concerning
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:37494:97"/>ſending into <hi>Scotland;</hi> and alſo the ſetling a Correſpondence with <hi>Argyle:</hi> That the Scotch Gentlemen Named to be ſent to, were <hi>Melvin, Cockran</hi> and the <hi>Cambels:</hi> That Colonel <hi>Sydney</hi> offer'd he would take care of the Perſon to be ſent, ſaying, <hi>he had one in his thoughts whom he judg'd a fit Man to he truſted,</hi> naming <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> for the Man: That as many of the Company as knew him, thought him a very proper Perſon for that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: That the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> undertook to invite <hi>Melvin</hi> hither; and a Letter was to be ſent to <hi>Cockran</hi> by <hi>Smith:</hi> That theſe Scotch-men were to be deſired to come, and acquaint their Council here, how they found <hi>Scotland</hi> temper'd; what opportunities or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages there might be of putting that Kingdom into a Commotion; and how they might there keep time and place with the Engliſh.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That ſhortly after this, the Deponent went to Colonel <hi>Sydney</hi>'s, and found him juſt going into <hi>London:</hi> That the ſaid Colonel took out of a Cabinet ſeveral Guinea's, ſaying, <hi>They were to be given to</hi> Aaron Smith <hi>for his Expences:</hi> That he was ſent accordingly; and the Colonel told the Deponent afterwards, <hi>He was
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:37494:97"/>gone, and was upon the Road, and that he had heard from him when he was about</hi> Newcaſtle.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was next plainly prov'd, That thoſe Scotch-men came up ſoon after <hi>Smith</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there. This was ſworn by Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Foſter,</hi> that <hi>Cockran, Monroe,</hi> and the two <hi>Cambels</hi> came to Town about the end of the Spring, or the beginning of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; <hi>Cockran</hi> and <hi>Monroe</hi> pretending their Buſineſs was a Purchaſe in <hi>Carolina;</hi> and that upon the very firſt rumour of a Plot, <hi>Cockran</hi> abſconded, <hi>Monroe</hi> and the <hi>Cambels</hi> were taken.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe <hi>Attherbury</hi> the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger alſo depoſed, <q>That about the end of <hi>June,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>July</hi> 1683, he was ſent by His Majeſties Warrant into <hi>London,</hi> upon a Diſcovery of ſome Scotch-men lodging in <hi>Black-Friers;</hi> but the Common-Sergeant of the City and others having been there before him, found them making their eſcape in a Boa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> That the Perſons were Sir <hi>High Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>l, Cockran,</hi> and another: That this was after they had been in Town but a little while.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The next Head of the Accuſation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern 'd the Treaſonable Pamphlet ſound in Colonel <hi>Sydney</hi>'s Study, at the time
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:37494:98"/>of his Apprehenſion. To this, firſt Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd</hi> Clerk of His Majeſties Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil depoſed, <q>That having been ſent by the King and Council to ſeize Colonel <hi>Sydney</hi>'s Papers, he did go, and put up what he found in his Cloſet: That he found thoſe Papers now given in Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence lying upon his Table where he uſually writ: That he ſeiz'd them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the later end of <hi>June:</hi> That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put them up, he offer'd Colonel <hi>Sydney</hi> that he might Seal them with his own Seal, but he refuſing, the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſet his Seal to them, and ſo deliver'd them to the Council.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Next it was made out, by as firm Proof as ſuch a Matter will bear, That all the Sheets produced were of Colonel <hi>Sydney</hi>'s own Hand-writing, which was evidenc'd by Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cary,</hi> Men of known Repute and Credit, who had long dealt with Mr. <hi>Sydney</hi> in Matters of Mony, and had paid divers Bills of Exchange for him, upon Notes written in the ſame Hand, and were never call'd to any account for Miſ-payment.</p>
               <p>Then were the Papers read, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rank Treaſon almoſt in every Line.</p>
               <p>For therein were broach'd and aſſerted many horrible Doctrines both againſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:37494:98"/>in general, and the Engliſh Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy in particular: which according to the uſual falſe Reaſoning of all Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Writers, he endeavour'd to juſtifie by divers Quotations and Examples of Sacred and Prophane Hiſtory groſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and miſapplied againſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Government of his Country.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, the whole deſign of thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers was to maintain, <hi>That Tyrants may be juſtly depoſed by the People; and that the People are the only Judges who are Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants:</hi> And peculiarly concerning this Nation there are theſe Expreſſions:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Power originally in the People of <hi>England</hi> is delegated to the Parliament. He, the King, is ſubject to the Law of God, as he is a Man; to the People that makes him a King, in as much as he is a King: The Law ſets a Meaſure to that Subjection: The Parliament is Judge of the particular Caſes thereupon ariſing: He muſt be content to ſubmit his Intereſt to theirs, ſince he is no more than any one of them in any other reſpect, than that he is by conſent of all rais'd above any other: If he doth not like this Condition, he may renounce the Crown: But if he receive it upon this Condition, (as all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates do the Power they receive) and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:37494:99"/>ſwear to perform it, he muſt expect the Performance will be exacted, or Revenge taken by thoſe he hath betray'd.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And in another place he ſays, <q>We may therefore change or take away Kings without breaking any Yoak; or that is made a Yoak, which ought not to be one. The Injury is in making, and impoſing, and there can be none in breaking it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And in another, <q>That the People muſt needs be the Judge of what happens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and the King, whom they did conſtitute. And in another, that as for the Peoples being Judges in their own Caſes, it is plain they ought to be the only Judges.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And in another, <q>That the Power of calling and diſſolving Parliaments is not in the King. And in another, 'That the general revolt of a Nation from its own Magiſtrates can never be call'd a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of the Treaſonable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets contain'd in Mr. <hi>Sydney</hi>'s Papers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many other Aſſertions that are equally Criminal, but too long to be here inſerted. Concerning all which villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Opinions this is certainly known, and confeſs'd by all good Men, That as
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:37494:99"/>they laid the Foundations of the late mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable War againſt his Majeſties bleſſed Father, and thereby occaſion'd the ſpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſo much Blood, even of the Royal Blood it ſelf; ſo when-ever the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhall be infected with the like Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monarchical Doctrines, it will be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the beſt Kings, or the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Kingdoms in the World, to be free from perpetual Treaſons, and Rebellious Plottings.</p>
               <p>To all this Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi>'s Anſwer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only made up of moſt of the ſame Pleas in Law that had been over-ruled, and the ſame objections againſt the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> which were ſatisfactorily repell'd in the former Tryals: beſides that he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly barely deny'd the ſending of <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> and his having any hand in, or knowledge of that Meſſage: And as for his Treaſonable Papers, he would not grant them to be his, or if they were found in his Study, he affirm'd <hi>That they might have been written many Years ago in anſwer to Sir</hi> R. Filmer<hi>'s Book of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; and written with no intention of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing them, but only for private diverſion, and the exerciſe of his Pen.</hi> In ſhort, his Defence conſiſting rather in Nice Cavils. at the known Forms of Law, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:37494:100"/>ridiculing the Deſign of a Council of Six, and the whole Conſpiracy it ſelf, than in any ſolid Arguments or Evidence to invalidate the Witneſſes, or to clear himſelf from the Crimes proved upon him, he was preſently found Guilty.</p>
               <p>His Execution in reſpect of his Quality, His Majeſty altered from the uſual Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of High Treaſon, into that of Severing his Head from his Body. At the time of his death on <hi>December</hi> the 7th he alſo deliver'd the Sheriffs a Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Paper: Wherein, after having excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his not ſpeaking what he wrote, by alledging this reaſon among others, <hi>That this was an Age, which makes Truth paſs for Treaſon;</hi> he objects againſt the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> the Infamy of his former Life; which Objection no Man in <hi>England</hi> had leſs cauſe to make than himſelf, the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> and he having been known to be entire Confidents, Familiars and Friends for many Years paſt of their Lives, and till the very time of the Diſcovery.</p>
               <p>Touching his Papers produced againſt him, he gives an account full of manifeſt Equivocations, and ambiguous Reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He ſufficiently intimates <hi>they were his own,</hi> but implies <hi>they were written long ago againſt a Book of Controverſie in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:37494:100"/>of Government.</hi> Thereupon he goes on, openly to juſtifie thoſe Papers, by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions dangerous enough to the Publick Peace, but quite different from what was laid to his charge at his Tryal, and was quoted word by word out of thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. For inſtead of being a general Diſcourſe for the Peoples Rights againſt Kings, without any particular Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Time or Place, as in this his laſt Paper he inſinuates them to have been; it is apparent to any Man that can but read, that thoſe Sheets of his Writing, which were given in Evidence, ſtruck at the very Root of the Engliſh Monarchy, and that therein he ſtudied to do his part to bring the Ax very near the Kings Neck once again.</p>
               <p>He farther, in that printed Speech, moſt injuriouſly reviles his Judges, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming with notorious falſhood and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulancy, <hi>That leſt the Means of deſtroying the beſt Proteſtants in</hi> England <hi>ſhould fail, the Bench was fill'd with ſuch as had been Blemiſhes to the Bar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He goes on to make divers the like fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous and groundleſs Reflections on the legal and regular Proceedings againſt him; concluding with a Prayer that could be dictated by none but a fierce Republican,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:37494:101"/>and a furious Enthuſiaſtical Spirit met together. It was in truth a Prayer more proper for their Treaſonable Meetings at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s or the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s, than to be uſed as the laſt words of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man dying in the profeſſion of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
               <p>For after having fondly declar'd, That <hi>he fell a Sacrifice to Idols,</hi> he thus addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his Speech to the great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: <hi>Bleſs thy People and ſave them. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thy own Cauſe; Defend thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it. Stir up ſuch as are faint, Direct thoſe that are willing. Confirm thoſe that waver. Give Wiſdom and Integrity unto all. Grant that I may dye glorifying thee for all thy Mercies; and that at the laſt thou haſt permitted me to be ſingled out as a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy Truth; and even by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of my Oppoſers, for that</hi> Old Cauſe <hi>in which I was from my Youth engaged, and for which thou haſt often wonderfully declar'd thy ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He makes it his laſt Glory, <hi>That he was engag'd in that Old Cauſe from his Youth;</hi> and he was ſo. Being yet very young he took up Rebellious Arms againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Bleſſed Father, and merited ſo well of that Old Cauſe, that he was thought rightly qualify'd to be Named, though
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:37494:101"/>he did not actually ſit, amongſt the black Number of the Regicides.</p>
               <p>Upon His Majeſties moſt happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, his fixt averſion to the reſtor'd Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was ſuch, that he would not perſonally accept of the Oblivion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity then generally granted to the whole Nation. But he voluntarily ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd himſelf for many Years; till about the Year 1677, he came into <hi>England</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and by His Majeſties ſpecial Grace obtain'd a particular Pardon, upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated promiſes of conſtant quiet, and Obedience for the time to come: Which how he made good, the World may Judge. In fine, he fell a memorable warning, and fatal Example to all the Engliſh No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry of this, and all future Ages; that they ſhould take heed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo far infatuated with the fancie and Chimerical Felicities of Ancient or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Commonwealths, as to deſpiſe and attempt the ruine of the far more ſolid Liberty and Happineſs to be injoy'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Engliſh Monarchy.</p>
               <p>On the 28th Day of <hi>November</hi> 1683, Mr. <hi>John Hambden</hi> Junior, having alſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> was arraign'd for High Miſdemeanor, and brought to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:37494:102"/>his Tryal the 6th of <hi>February</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>In this Tryal, the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively depoſed to the ſame ſenſe as before touching the general Tranſactions of the Conſpiracy till the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Death; and particularly afterwards of the Meeting of the Council of Six at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s own Houſe, where Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> made an Introductory Speech to open the Aſſembly: and the ſubject of their Debates was concerning the Time, Place, Men, Arms and Mony to be provided towards a Riſing; and alſo that then the ſending a Meſſenger into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was propoſed, and referred to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated the next Meeting.</p>
               <p>Farther, That Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at that next Meeting at the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Houſe; and amongſt the reſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated of ſending the Meſſenger into <hi>Scotland;</hi> when <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> was named, and approved to be the Man.</p>
               <p>But the ſubſtance of the Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Evidence having been before ſufficiently ſet down, it will be needleſs now to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low exactly every Circumſtance of it. It is enough only to note, That moſt of the ſame Objections being again repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Defendents Council, had the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:37494:102"/>ſame or like Anſwers return'd them by the King's.</p>
               <p>There was indeed one new and very material thing then firſt particularly and unqueſtionably made out in this Tryal, which was the certainty of <hi>Aaron Smith</hi>'s carrying the Treaſonable Meſſage into <hi>Scotland.</hi> This was now demonſtrably proved by <hi>Sheriff</hi> and <hi>Bell,</hi> both Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Newcaſtle; Sheriff</hi> being the Man at whoſe Houſe <hi>Smith</hi> lay in his paſſage to and fro, and <hi>Bell</hi> the very Guide that went thence to conduct him into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching this Matter; Firſt, <hi>Atther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> one of the Kings Meſſengers teſtified, <q>That <hi>Sheriff</hi> and <hi>Bell</hi> had a full view of <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> who was brought for that purpoſe from the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> before the King: That <hi>Sheriff</hi> and <hi>Bell</hi> did then own <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> to be the Man who had paſs'd under the Name of <hi>Clerk:</hi> That <hi>Sheriff</hi> declar'd the ſaid <hi>Clerk</hi> lay at his Houſe; and <hi>Bell</hi> ſaid that he travell'd towards <hi>Scotland</hi> with him, being hired to ſhew him the way:</q> That to all this <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> would not anſwer one word.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Sheriff</hi> himſelf depoſed, <q>That he keeping the <hi>Black-Spread-Eagle</hi> in <hi>Newcaſtle, Aaron Smith</hi> came to his Houſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:37494:103"/>about the middle of <hi>February</hi> 1683: That he ſtaid there one Night, went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and return'd again in twelve days, or thereabout: That he travell'd from his Houſe Northward towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> but firſt deſir'd one might be got to ſhew him the way: That to that purpoſe the Deponent ſent for <hi>Bell,</hi> whom <hi>Smith</hi> preſently hired to go with him: That when <hi>Smith</hi> came back, he lay another Night at his Houſe, and ſo return'd into the South towards <hi>London:</hi> That <hi>Smith</hi> went all the while by the Name of <hi>Clerk:</hi> That the Deponent directed him to a Gentleman at <hi>Jadburgh,</hi> which is Forty Miles from <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and within Six Miles of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Bell</hi> ſwore, <q>That <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> was the very Man who went by the Name of <hi>Clerk.</hi> That the Deponent living at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and getting his Livelihood by letting out Horſes and guiding of Travellers; <hi>Sheriff</hi> ſent for him, told him the ſaid <hi>Clerk</hi> wanted a Guide into <hi>Scotland:</hi> That this happen'd on the <hi>Thurſday</hi> before <hi>Shrove Tueſday:</hi> That the next Morning being <hi>Friday,</hi> he conduced <hi>Smith</hi> towards <hi>Jadburgh;</hi> that on the <hi>Saturday</hi> the Deponents Horſe was tyr'd; ſo <hi>Smith</hi> left him taking another
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:37494:103"/>Guide; appointing him to come after as faſt as he could to <hi>Jadburgh:</hi> That the Deponent overtook him there on <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day;</hi> and on <hi>Monday</hi> Morning ſaw him take Horſe with another Guide for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſaying he was going towards <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas:</hi> That <hi>Bell</hi> presently went back to <hi>Newcaſtle:</hi> where he ſaw <hi>Smith</hi> and diſcours'd with him, upon his return out of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then it was alſo proved by Sir <hi>Andrew Foſter</hi> and <hi>Attherbury,</hi> 
                  <q>That the Scotch-Men ſent for by <hi>Smith</hi>'s Meſſage, did come, and ſtaid in Town, till upon the Diſcovery of the Plot, they were either taken or abſconded.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By this plain Evidence of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Stages of <hi>Smith</hi>'s Journy, that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable intercourſe with <hi>Scotland</hi> was made out beyond all poſſibility of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation. So that from the very time of the Conſultations at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s, and the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s about ſending a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger; the Truth of Colonel <hi>Sydney</hi>'s un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to ſend one; of his naming <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> for the Meſſenger; of <hi>Smith</hi>'s going to <hi>Scotland;</hi> of the Scotch-Mens coming up that were ſent for; and of their being ſurprized, endeavouring to hide themſelves, upon the firſt breaking
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:37494:104"/>forth of the Plot; all this appears to be indiſputably confirm'd, and trac'd ſtep by ſtep, almoſt from Day to Day, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if theſe <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Mens Depoſitions ſhall be compar'd with the Teſtimony that is ſubjoyn'd of two Scotch-Men <hi>Thomas Steil,</hi> and <hi>Oliver,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Aaron Smith</hi>'s actual arrival in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and what he did whilſt he was there at that time.</p>
               <p>The iſſue was, Mr. <hi>Hambden was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately found Guilty of the High Treſpaſs and Miſdemeanor, and thereupon fined</hi> 40000 <hi>l.</hi>
                  <hi>to the King, and order'd to give Sureties for his Good Behaviour during Life.</hi> A Puniſhment that cannot but be eſteem'd very moderate, conſidering the Nature of his Crime, which nothing but the want of another poſitive Witneſs could have made leſs than High Treaſon. And the King cannot but here take this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on once for all, to give the World No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this Infallible Inſtance of his mild and merciful Proceedings towards the Conſpirators. For His Majeſty does ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly declare, <q>That if he had not granted the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Requeſt <hi>That he would not make him a Witneſs,</hi> neither Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> nor ſcarce any one Man of all thoſe that were freed upon
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:37494:104"/>Bail, had eſcaped Death.</q> Not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion divers others, whom the ſaid Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> named as Parties in the Conſpiracy, that were never yet que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd.</p>
               <p>On the 14th of <hi>June</hi> 1684, Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Armſtrong</hi> having been taken in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was brought to the <hi>Kings-Bench Bar,</hi> upon an Outlawry againſt him for High Treaſon. Whereupon the Kings Attorney demanded <hi>An Award of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Since upon his not appearing, when formerly Indicted of High Treaſon, he was now by the courſe of Law attainted for the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Armſtrong</hi> being ask'd, <hi>What he could ſay for himſelf?</hi> alledg'd, <hi>He was beyond Sea at the time of the Outlawry, and beg'd he might be Try'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was anſwer'd, <hi>That after a Record of Outlawry, the Judges had nothing to do but to appoint Execution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt this <hi>Armſtrong</hi> urg'd, <hi>That by the Statute of the 6th of</hi> Edward the Sixth, <hi>the Perſon Outlaw'd had a Years time to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe the Outlawry, if he were beyond Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Bench reply'd <q>That by the plain words of that Statute, none could have the benefit of it, but ſuch as within one
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:37494:105"/>Year ſhould yield themſelves to the Chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> and offer to Traverſe the Indictment upon which the Outlawry was pronounc'd.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this <hi>Armſtrong</hi> pleaded, <hi>That the Year not being yet out, he did now render himſelf to the Chief Juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that Plea not being admitted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not yield himſelf according to the ſenſe of the Act, but was brought a Priſoner, and ſo could have no Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the <hi>Proviſo</hi> in the Statute; <hi>Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong</hi> alledg'd, <q>That the ſame Favour had been lately granted to another, meaning <hi>Holloway,</hi> who though he was in the ſame condition of Outlawry, yet was offer'd to take his Tryal if he pleas'd.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was anſwer'd, <q>That was done out of the meer Grace and Favour of the King, who if his Majeſty thought good, might extend the like Favour to him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. But that was not the buſineſs of a Court of Juſtice; they were only to take care to ſatisfy the Law.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, the Kings Attorney ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Court, <q>That the Priſoner at the Bar deſerv'd no fort of Indulgence or Mercy from the King; not only for that when he was ſeiz'd beyond Sea,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:37494:105"/>Letters of freſh Communication with Foreign Miniſters and other People were taken about him, but alſo becauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to His Majeſty by full Evidence poſitively given, That after the Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Meeting at the <hi>Rye</hi> by Gods Providence in the Fire at <hi>New-market, Armſtrong</hi> was one of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that actually engag'd to go upon the Kings haſty coming to Town, and to deſtroy him by the way as he came.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then was he order'd to be Executed <hi>June</hi> the 20th. At the place of Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he likewiſe deliver'd the Sheriffs a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, wherein he continued to Object againſt the legal Courſe of the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon him, complaining, <q>That with an unordinary roughneſs he had been condemn'd, and made a Preſident, though <hi>Holloway</hi> being alſo Outlaw'd, had his Tryal offer'd him a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As to the new Evidence againſt him, which the Kings Attorny mention'd at the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> he only anſwer'd it by a bold and flat denial: affirming upon his Death, <hi>He never had any Deſign againſt the Kings Life, nor the Life of any Man;</hi> both which may be eaſily allow'd to be equally true.</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:37494:106"/>
               <p>But to evince the contrary as to the Kings Life, it will be ſufficient to ſet down the very words of the Lord <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>'s Depoſition, together with the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Colonel <hi>Romzey,</hi> which the Kings Attorney had then ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, amongſt many other old and clear Proofs to convince him of deſigning the Kings Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Howard</hi> having firſt confeſs'd ſome Diſcourſe between the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and himſelf, in <hi>October</hi> of 1683, wherein the ſaid Duke had propoſed the failing on the King at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> goes on in theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Upon Reflection I am apt to think, that from this time and not before, the Deſign of way-laying the King in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>London,</hi> was firſt meditated. And I am the more confirm'd in this Opinion from the Conſideration of the Behaviour of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and the Lord <hi>Gray;</hi> who ſeem'd to be very big of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſome great thing to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted upon the Day of the Kings co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from <hi>Newmarket;</hi> upon which Day (as I have before obſerv'd) Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> was not to be found till the Kings Coaches were come into
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:37494:106"/>Town: And I do verily believe he was to have Headed the Party.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This very Particular the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> gave in upon Oath among his firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions to His Majeſty. Nor can any Man think it ſufficient to invalidate the Truth of this, that <hi>Armſtrong</hi> in his laſt Paper calls it a <hi>baſe Reflection,</hi> affirming <hi>He could have prov'd it to be a manifeſt falsehood;</hi> conſidering that Colonel <hi>Rom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zey</hi> alſo upon notice of <hi>Armſtrong</hi>'s being taken, made Oath in theſe very words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> did come to me the <hi>Sunday</hi>-night after the Fire at <hi>New-market,</hi> and told me, That he juſt came from <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> and that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King and Duke were to return ſo ſoon, yet <hi>Ferguſon</hi> did not doubt to have Men ready by that time to do the Buſineſs; and deſired me to go with him to <hi>Ferguſon</hi>'s Lodging in his Coach, which I did. When I came there, <hi>Fergu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> told me the ſame, but that they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Money. Upon which Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to Lend ſome, and he would ſee me Repaid; and added, That if he had been in Stock, he would have done it himſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After this, the King could not think himſelf in the leaſt bound to go out of the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:37494:107"/>way of the Law, for ſhewing any diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Act of Grace to Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong;</hi> eſpecially when it is manifeſt there was ſcarce a Man living, who had more Perſonal obligations to His Majeſty than he had; and yet no Man had made more ungrateful returns for them, than he had done. Nor could His Majeſty for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, how many other Perſons, and ſome very near his Majeſty, Sir <hi>Thomas Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong</hi> had been the Chief Inſtrument of perverting. Upon which account His Majeſty had reaſon to look on him, as the Author of many more Treaſons beſides his own.</p>
               <p>There is now ſcarce any thing mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial left unmention'd relating to the Proof either of the Aſſaſſination or Inſurrection, but what may be readily ſupplied, by any intelligent Reader, out of the Original Records of Informations and Confeſſions, whereof by His Majeſties Command, there are Copies an next to this Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for an Authentick Confirmation of its Truth. Only the King is pleas'd that a more particular account ſhould be given than has been hitherto made Publick, of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s rendring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, of the Reaſons then moving His Majeſty to grant him his Pardon, and of what's toriety of the Fact and all the Circum
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:37494:107"/>what happen'd immediately upon it, which occaſion'd the ſaid Dukes final Diſgrace and Baniſhment from His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties preſence.</p>
               <p>As to the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in the <hi>Tower</hi> ſome few days after his Impriſonment there, His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty cannot think it becomes Him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to any particular Juſtification of his own, or his Miniſters Innocency in that Calamitous Accident.</p>
               <p>Though His Majeſty is not ignorant, that divers moſt Malicious Pamphlets have been lately ſpread abroad in Engliſh, and other Languages, which with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd Impudence have accus'd ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perſons of eminent Virtue and Honour about His Majeſty, not ſparing even his Royal Highneſs; nay ſcarce freeing the King himſelf, from being Perſonally Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of ſo Baſe and Barbarous an Action.</p>
               <p>But after the Truth of the whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has been carefully examin'd and aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Coroners Inqueſt, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Buſineſs it was; and after <hi>Braddon</hi> has ſuffer'd the Puniſhment of the Law, for Suborning even Children to bear falſe Witneſs in the Caſe; and after the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriety
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:37494:108"/>of the Fact, and all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it, have been ſo clearly made out, that there is not a Man in all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> of an honeſt Mind, or ſound Senſe, who does in the leaſt doubt it; His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty diſdains to enter into diſpute with every Petulant Scribler, or to anſwer the villanous Suggeſtions and horrid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies contain'd particularly in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel call'd <hi>The Detection,</hi> and in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of it; the one written by <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> the other by <hi>Danvers;</hi> both infamous Men, and mortal Enemies to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Government and Perſon.</p>
               <p>Yet His Majeſty cannot but think it deſerves Obſervation, That when the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had ſo many conſiderable Relations and Alliances with divers the greateſt Families in the Kingdom; and when neither his Lady, nor Brother, nor any one of all his Numerous Friends and Noble Kindred, who were moſt nearly concern'd, did ever expreſs the leaſt Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of foul dealing or ill practiſe upon the ſaid unfortunate Earl; and when all Mens Eyes are open'd, and ſcarce a Man of their own Party has any ſcruple in his Thoughts about that Buſineſs; yet that now at laſt their old Advocate of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>Ferguſon</hi> ſhould come forth in Print,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:37494:108"/>to out-face ſo clear a Demonſtration of Truth, and ſhould try ſtill to turn the Envy of that unhappy Stroak on the Court, and the King, and his deareſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It cannot but ſeem a prodigious Confidence and Preſumption, that <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſon</hi> ſhould be their choſen Champion in this Cauſe! The Man, who by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Depoſitions ſtands Outlaw'd and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict of having had the greateſt ſhare in the blackeſt part of the Conſpiracy! The Man, in accuſing whom almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Witneſs both Scotch and Engliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, ſo that his Crimes have been proved by more than Twenty plain Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences; particularly the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> himſelf having confeſs'd to His Majeſty, <hi>That in all their Debates</hi> Fergu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>was always for Cutting of Throats;</hi> ſaying, <hi>That was the moſt Compendious Way.</hi> That this very <hi>Ferguſon</hi> ſhould ſo far make good his own words at parting, when he vow'd, <hi>He would never be out of a Plot as long as he lived!</hi> That now in his Baniſhment under the load of ſo many undeniable Treaſons, he ſhould ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as the great Patron of the Old Cauſe, and ſhould preſume he can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on the World in a matter of Fact ſo fully try'd, ſo clearly prov'd and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined!
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:37494:109"/>mined! What can be a greater Impudence, than that <hi>Ferguſon</hi> ſhould ſtill expect that he could make any Man living believe, the King himſelf, or the Duke of <hi>York</hi> could ever be induced to practice his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Way</hi> on the Earl of <hi>Eſſex?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However from this one inſtance the King hopes the World will judge, how moſt Injuriouſly and Barbarouſly he has been uſed by his Adverſaries in their other Libels againſt him; in moſt of which it is well known the ſame venemous Pen was employ'd.</p>
               <p>As for the deplorable end of the ſaid Earl, His Majeſty freely owns, there was no Man in his Dominions more deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with it than himſelf: His Majeſty having been thereby deprived of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Opportunity to exerciſe his Royal Clemency; and to teſtifie to all his Loyal Subjects and Old Friends, how highly he valued the Memory and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lord <hi>Capel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next himſelf, His Majeſty thinks he is alſo bound in common Juſtice to declare, That his entirely beloved Brother was moſt tenderly concern'd and griev'd at that lamentable Effect of the Earl of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi>'s Deſpair: His Majeſty being beſt able, upon his own knowledge to vouch
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:37494:109"/>for the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> That he never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd ill of the ſaid Earl, and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways moſt readily inclined, for both their Fathers ſakes, to have forgiven what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ill the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had done to him.</p>
               <p>Now touching His Majeſties Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and what followed upon it, the King is pleaſed this Account ſhall be given.</p>
               <p>The World needs not be told with what extraordinary regret to His Majeſty, the ſaid Duke was of late Years pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that ſenſe of his Duty and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, His Majeſty might juſtly claim from him, upon many more Obligations beſides that of being his Subject.</p>
               <p>But it was one of the firſt and principal Artifices of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, after his own diſgrace at Court, to be reveng'd on the King, by afflicting him in ſo tender a part, and by ſly Inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, to wreſt from his Boſom a Perſon, who he knew, had ſo great a ſhare in His Majeſties Affections.</p>
               <p>This was indeed a Talent peculiar to the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> That of all Men living he could moſt eaſily turn himſelf into all ſhapes, and comply with all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:37494:110"/>poſitions; having by long practice, got the skill to cover his Hooks with Baits fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting every Humour. The Covetous, who are no ſmall Number of the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Godly Party, thoſe he was wont to feed, and deceive with hopes of Wealth and new Sequeſtrations: The Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with Praiſe and Vain-Glory: The Nonconformiſt Zealots, with Promiſes of Liberty in Religion; ſometimes not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to ſtoop lower, and even to ſerve and aſſiſt the Pleaſures and Debauches of Men that way inclin'd, if he found them any way uſeful for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the ſaid Earl obſerving in the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> a Mind raſh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady and ambitious, ſoon made him an eaſie Prey to his wicked Subtilty, diſguiſed under fair and plauſible Colours: On the one ſide, puffing up his Youthful Thoughts with a vain Oſtentation of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the Temptation of Fame to be gotten by Aſſerting and Defending his Countries Liberties and Religion, always pretended by him to be in imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whilſt He was out of place: On the other, inflaming him with imaginary Suſpicions of the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable Hatred to his Perſon. Which
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:37494:110"/>was ſo far from having any real Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that on the contrary, His Majeſty, who beſt knows, does freely here teſtifie for his deareſt Brother in this particular, That the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> till he made himſelf uncapable of his Friendſhip, never had a more entire, or faſt Friend about His Majeſty; and there was ſcarce ever any Honour or Benefit conferr'd on him, but it was obtain'd of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty by his Royal Highneſſes Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>However by ſuch groundleſs Jealouſies and empty Conceits, was the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> inſenſibly drawn to deſert his only true Intereſt, and to give himſelf over to the Deluſions of His Majeſties mortal Enemies.</p>
               <p>This the King apparently perceiving, and foreſeeing how in the Event it would tend to the ſaid Dukes inevitable Ruine, His Majeſty tryed by all imaginable ways of Kindneſs to caſt forth the Evil Spirit in him, and to reſcue him out of their Hands. At length, when no milder courſe would ſerve, His Majeſty required him on his Allegiance, to go beyond the Seas, and there to remain till his farther pleaſure was ſignified. His Majeſty ſtill hoping, that at ſo great a diſtance the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:37494:111"/>Poyſon would be leſt effectual, and that by his abſence the ſaid Duke would be kept Innocent of the Treaſonable deſigns which his New Aſſociates were furiouſly carrying on againſt the Government.</p>
               <p>But in that expectation His Majeſty was unfortunately diſappointed. The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> preſently ſhew'd, how much his Falſe Friends and Treacherous Flatterers had prevailed over his unwary Youth; and how different they had taught him to be from the Obedience, which at the ſame time was practiſed by his Royal Highneſs. For the ſaid Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> ſoon return'd into <hi>England</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to His Majeſties expreſs Command.</p>
               <p>The diſcontented Party having thus got him again, and made him ſurer to themſelves by this new Affront to His Majeſty, began now to take new Life and Vigor by his preſence: With inſufferable Boldneſs and Contempt of Authority, ſhewed him every where to the Rabble; Leading him about with inſolent Pomp, through many Countries; openly own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and crying him up as the Head of their Cauſe; the unhappy Young-Man all the white not underſtanding that he was only a Property.</p>
               <p>By theſe fatal ſteps he was was at laſt
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:37494:111"/>brought into the moſt pernicious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Undertakings. And whilſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs was intended by his Tempters but the ſubverſion of all that is well-ſettled and ſacred in Church and State; they deluded him into the very ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, by popular Shews and empty Names of the Proteſtant Duke, the great Champion and Protector of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the Subject and the Reformed Religon: Which under His Majeſty, can never want any other Protector; nor can ever ſtand in need of ſuch Champions as many of late have vaunted themſelves to be, of whole Religion there can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven no better Account than of their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty.</p>
               <p>Such then was the ſtate of things, when upon the firſt breaking forth of this Horrid Conſpiracy, His Majeſty with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible Surprize and Grief, Found by undoubted Evidence the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> very deeply engaged; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had but too juſt reaſon to put him into a Proclamation among the other Conſpirators: After that the ſaid Duke had withdrawn himſelf from His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Juſtice, and ſo long was become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of his Forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p>In this obſtinate defiance the Duke of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37494:112"/>
                  <hi>Monmouth</hi> continued, till the Outlawry againſt him, and other his Complices began to draw to an Iſſue. Then His Majeſty receiv'd from him the firſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: In which His Majeſty fancy'd he ſaw a greater Spirit of Ingenuity than after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards proved. However finding in it ſo clear and full expreſſions of the ſaid Dukes remorſe for his former Diſloyalty to His Majeſty and Ingratitude to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and ſo frank Profeſſions of his Reſolutions to amend for the future, joyn'd with the greateſt Imprecations on himſelf; if he ſhould wilfully violate his Promiſes therein made: His Majeſty did thereupon immediately return this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer written with his own Hand, (that His Majeſty might not be wanting on his part to lay hold on any good and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Opportunity of reducing him to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſaving him from utter Ruine:) <hi>If the Duke of</hi> Monmouth <hi>deſires to make himſelf capable of my Mercy, he muſt render himſelf to the Secretary, and reſolve to tell me all he knows, reſigning himſelf entirely to my Pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This determinate Declaration of His Majeſties Will, drew from the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> a ſecond Letter; wherein with vehement and pathetick Words he aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:37494:112"/>his Diſtraction and Torment for having offended His Majeſty. Confeſſes <hi>Himſelf in fault, betray'd into fatal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, miſled into Miſchiefs, whereof he did not at firſt, in the leaſt, ſuſpect the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences:</hi> declares, <hi>That his Crime ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to him in ſo terrifying a ſhape, that he preferr'd even Death before his preſent ſenſe of it:</hi> implores <hi>His Majeſties Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don no otherwiſe, but if he may receive it by his Royal Highneſſes Mediation:</hi> profeſſes <hi>To ſpeak this not only in outward Form, but with the greateſt Sincerity in the World:</hi> reſigns <hi>Himſelf to His Majeſties Diſpoſal, not only now, but for the remainder of his Life:</hi> engages <hi>Abſolutely to put his very Will into His Majeſties Hands for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which he acknowledges had been ſo ill a Guide to him in times paſt:</hi> concluding, <hi>That till he could receive ſome comfortable Return to this his unfeigned Submiſſion, he was the moſt miſerable, diſconſolate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the Receipt of this ſecond Letter, the King being perſwaded there could be no room left to queſtion the Sincerity of a real Change in the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and knowing he had now enough in his Hands to overwhelm him with Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it ſhould prove otherwiſe, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:37494:113"/>did thereupon without any more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, immediately admit him into his Preſence, being introduced by Mr. Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Jenkins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Secretary was withdrawn, there being none elſe preſent but his Royal Highneſs, His Majeſty can have no other Teſtimony beſides of what paſt between them but God, who knows all things; And to the ſame God His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty appeals, as well as to his deareſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Nothing doubting but if the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſhall ever return to any ſenſe of his Duty to God and his King, he himſelf will be a third Witneſs of the Truth of what His Majeſty now declares; <hi>That the Duke of</hi> Monmouth, <hi>with Signs of the moſt humble Contrition and ſincere Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for his paſt Miſcarriages, did then fully and freely acknowledge his having been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of the Conſpiracy; and gave His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty much greater Light into many Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of it than he could poſſibly elſe have obtain'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, His Majeſty does not deny the ſaid Duke perſiſted to the laſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing any the leaſt knowledge or thought of the Aſſaſſinating part. Nor did His Majeſty much preſs him on that ſide; his Royal Indulgence eaſily inclining
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:37494:113"/>him to wiſh and to believe, That One who had the Honour to be taken ſo near to him, could not be guilty of ſo vile a Parricide.</p>
               <p>But of the other part, the Trayterous Deſign to ſeize on His Majeſties Perſon, and ſubvert the preſent Government by an Inſurrection; of that His Majeſty muſt own and profeſs on the Word of a King, The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> made no ſcruple to confeſs his ſhare; and ſo largely to ſet it forth, that there was little of the Conſpiracy before known, which the ſaid Duke did not confirm; and many Paſſages of it were before unknown, which he reveal'd.</p>
               <p>After this His Majeſty made no delay to give him many certain Proofs of his entire Forgiveneſs of all paſt Offences, and of his renew'd Affections and Royal Bounty to him for the future; preſently cheriſhing him near his own Perſon with his wonted Tenderneſs; declaring in Council the perfect Contentment he had receiv'd by his Submiſſion, and ordering his Pardon to be diſpatch'd with all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; promiſing him withal at his earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Intreaty, <hi>That he ſhould not be a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> a Favour refuſed to the late Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> in <hi>France</hi> upon the like occaſion.</p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:37494:114"/>
               <p>Yet no ſooner was the Pardon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in due Form of Law, but His Majeſty and the whole Court was afreſh Alarm'd with the continual reſort to him of divers Perſons, whom His Majeſty knew to be engag'd, and had Proof ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to Convict them in courſe of Law, if he would have produced it all.</p>
               <p>To this at the ſame time were added many arrogant and impudent Speeches of his late Complices and Dependants, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That the ſaid Duke had wade no Confeſſion, but had aſſerted the Innocency of ſome that had ſuffer'd.</hi> Which manifeſtly tended to vilifie the Truth of the whole Diſcovery, and to bring a Scandal on all the Proceedings of His Majeſties Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p>Wherefore at laſt His Majeſty was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken'd, and thought fit to put him gently in mind by what was ſo lately paſt, of his danger of relapſing into the ſame Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice, out of which nothing but his Royal Goodneſs had recover'd him. And for the better Security of the ſaid Duke himſelf, as well as of the Kingdom for the time to come, His Majeſty inſtantly demanded of him to give ſome ſuch Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the whole Nation in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, as he had but juſt before given
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:37494:114"/>His Majeſty and his Royal Highneſs in private.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſeeming willing to comply with His Majeſties molt Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deſires, all that His Majeſty obliged him to do, was to Write over, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a Letter, which His Majeſty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was pleas'd ſo to word, as not only to conſult the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Safety, but alſo his Credit, as much as could poſſibly ſtand with his Majeſties own Safety or Credit. For His Majeſty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him in that Letter wholly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himſelf of the Bloody Aſſaſſination, and only required him to own again his part in the Inſurrection. And His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty leaves it to all the World to Judge, whether in this Letter, of His Majeſties own preſcribing, he did not expreſs the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Guilt far more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, than the ſaid Duke himſelf had done in his own Letters to His Majeſty, before his Pardon was Sealed.</p>
               <p>This Letter the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> readily Subſcribed, and Preſented to His Majeſty. But his former ill Adherents and Corrupters ſtill flocking about him in great Numbers, and Animating him to <hi>continue Faithful to his Old Friends of the Party;</hi> aſſuring him, <hi>he could not fail in
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:37494:115"/>little time to overbear all that ſhould ſtand in his way, by the Power of his recover'd and increas'd Favour;</hi> by theſe and ſuch like Miſchievous Inſtigations, they ſoon got ſo much the better of his unſtable Mind, as to overthrow all his new-made Vows of Loyalty.</p>
               <p>Inſomuch that preſently after he came raſhly to the King, <hi>and earneſtly intreated the foreſaid Letter might be return'd him again;</hi> having been inſtructed to pretend a Fear, <hi>that ſome opportunity might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from it by his Enemies to blaſt his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and perhaps to bring him in to give Evidence againſt others his Companions in the Conſpiracy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Majeſty had often before ſaid and promiſed enough to him to free the Mind of any reaſonable Man from ſuch Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. But when all Proteſtations of that kind, on His Majeſties Part, could have no effect; and the ſaid Duke ſtill vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently inſiſted, <hi>That the Paper he had ſign'd might be delivered him back,</hi> His Majeſty once for all told him, <hi>he would never keep it againſt his will,</hi> that he might not have the leaſt occaſion to ſay he was forced to write what he did: But withal ſeriouſly warn'd him to conſider what irreparable ill conſequences on his
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:37494:115"/>part, were likely to follow upon his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy: and therefore gave him time till the next Morning to deliberate calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with himſelf, what was to be his final Reſolution.</p>
               <p>The next day the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> appearing ſtill more fixt in his perverſe Demand, His Majeſty freely put the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter again into his Hands; but withal from that moment baniſh'd him His Preſence and the Court.</p>
               <p>Nor can His Majeſty reflect on the ſaid Duke's undutiful Behaviour in the iſſue of this whole Affair, without an extream Indignation, to find, that after ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive and ample a Confeſſion of his Crime, both by Writing and Speech, he ſhould not only give no other ſign of his Repentance, but that the very firſt uſe he ſhould make of his Majeſties Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pardon for it, was to take by it the advantage of entring more ſecurely on a pew courſe of Diſobedience.</p>
               <p>The King has thus condeſcended to ſet-forth an Impartial Relation of the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Proceeding, and Defeat of that whole deteſtable Conſpiracy. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty has ſo long delay'd the Publication of it, chiefly in Conſideration of many of the Criminals themſelves, how ill ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:37494:116"/>ever they may have deſerv'd of him. For the Law allowing them the ſpace of a whole Year, after the Outlawry, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves before they were to be look'd on as Men abſolutely condemn'd, His Majeſty was willing to ſtay till the full time was expired; ſtill hoping, that ſome of them would come voluntarily in, and ſtand a Legal Tryal, and, if poſſible, prove themſelves Innocent.</p>
               <p>But ſince not one of the Perſons Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law'd has all this while ventured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the Laws of his Country, His Majeſty has now thought it not fit any longer to ſuppreſs the Evidence againſt them. And what is here publiſh'd, though it be not near the whole of the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions given in upon Oath, yet will be found abundantly ſufficient to Convict every Man of them, either of the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Inſurrection or Aſſaſſination; Both which His Majeſty knows are made out with as much clearneſs of Teſtimony, and ſtrength of indubitable Records, as any Humane Affair is capable of.</p>
               <p>What now remains? But that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhould engage himſelf before God and the whole World, to make a right uſe of ſo great a Bleſſing as his Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from theſe deſperate Treaſons; and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:37494:116"/>ſhould with the Authority of a King, and with the tender Affection of a true Father of his Country, require and admoniſh all his Subjects of all Parties and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to do the like.</p>
               <p>For himſelf, his Majeſty cannot but be deeply ſenſible he has been now once more preſerv'd by the immediate Hand of God; and therefore looks on himſelf as afreſh obliged to manifeſt his Gratitude to Heaven, by promoting the Glory of his Preſerver, in continuing to conſult above all things the Welfare of his Church, and the Peace and Happineſs of this great People committed to his Charge.</p>
               <p>And His Majeſty declares he will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this new Advantage the Divine Favour has ſo marvellouſly put into his Hands, not in Acts of Severity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, which his Nature utterly abhors; but by imitating the Divine Goodneſs, as in a regular Courſe of ſtrict Juſtice to all obdurate Impenitents, ſo, which he much rather deſires, in his uſual method of Mercy and Kindneſs to as many as ſhall give ſincere Proofs of Penitence, and Reformation of their paſt Crimes; Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which His Majeſty has too much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe his and his Fathers Enemies have hitherto been very little acquainted with.</p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:37494:117"/>
               <p>As for thoſe His Majeſties miſguided Subjects, who after all this perſevere to be diſaffected to His Government, His Majeſty has reaſon to expect that now at length they would be convinc'd by that very Providence which uſed to be their own principal and beſt-beloved Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whenever it ſeem'd to be never ſo little on their ſide; and that henceforth they would quietly ſubmit to, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame Providence; ſince it has ſo ſignally appear'd againſt them, and much more wonderfully declar'd it ſelf for, than ever Mr. <hi>Sydney</hi> had reaſon to ſay, it had declar'd againſt His Majeſty.</p>
               <p>If there can poſſibly ſtill remain any well meaning Men in their Party, led away by the ſpecious Deluſions of good Words abuſed to the worſt things; if any ſuch have really thought their Lives and Fortunes, Laws and Conſciences at any time in Danger, under His Majeſties Government; let them but Remember and conſider ſadly what was the Iſſue of the very ſame Jealouſies, Murmurs and Tumults againſt His Royal Father of Bleſſed Memory; whether the firſt and moſt eminent Inſtruments of ſubverting, for a time, this Renown'd, and ancient Monarchy, were not themſelves beguil'd
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:37494:117"/>by the ſame methods into the meaneſt Slavery, both Spiritual and Temporal: Out of which they were compell'd at laſt to confeſs, they could be no other wiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd, but by returning again into the very ſame conſtitution of things, they had ſo unwiſely overthrown?</p>
               <p>Or if the Experience of time paſt, ſo dearly bought, can prevail nothing on them, let them but ſeriouſly reflect on their preſent Condition. Inſtead of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to what wicked and deſigning Men, under the moſt deceitful Colours ſuggeſt to them for Siniſter Ends, let them guide their Opinions by their own plain and ſenſible Obſervation. Let them but fairly and indifferently compare the preſent State of all Nations round about them with their own: And then let them refuſe, if they can, to bleſs God and the King, for their inexpreſſible advantages above all others.</p>
               <p>Whilſt dl His Majeſties Subjects find they may if they will ſecurely injoy Peace, Plenty, Liberty, and the beſt Religion; why ſhould any Torment themſelves, or diſquiet others with wild imaginations and Fears of future Evils? Which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſo ready a way to bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as their own Fears.</p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:37494:118"/>
               <p>Henceforth therefore let no vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Liberty and Property once more puſh them on to the ſame deſperate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, wherein when they had formerly ſucceſs (which they cannot always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe themſelves) yet even then it turn'd within a few Years to the Ruine of their own Pretences.</p>
               <p>Let no miſtaken Zeal of Conſcience ſeduce them again to Diſobedience, ſince the only Obligations of a True Chriſtian Conſcience lead all to Obedience, none to Rebellion.</p>
               <p>Let them no longer be infatuated by the falſe Shews and Inſinuations of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity: Rather let them learn once for all, who is the only true Patriot, what is truly Popular, what not.</p>
               <p>Let them know, That whoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies with the common Peoples ſudden Humors and changeable Paſſions, againſt their ſolid Intereſt; Whoever labours to make the whole Government obnoxious to any ſingle Sect or Party; Whoever ſtrives to divide the Country or City from the Court; Whoever endeavours to enlarge diſputable Priviledges, to the hazard of known Prerogatives; In fine, Whoever would pervert Liberty into Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs, that Man can never be a
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:37494:118"/>True Patriot; all that is falſe Popularity: It is indeed equally as Deſtructive to the People as to the Prince.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Counſels only are and ought to be eſteem'd really Popular, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on ſure and legal Foundations, to confirm the Monarchy where it is ſtrong, to ſtrengthen and ſupport thoſe parts of it, which by length of time may have been ſomewhat weaken'd and decay'd. thoſe Perſons only are the True Patriots, and deſign their Countries Good the beſt and only ſure way, who make it their Buſineſs to keep the King in a condition to protect his People. There is no true, commendable Engliſh Popularity, but true Engliſh Loyalty.</p>
               <p>Thus much His Majeſty vouchſafes to adviſe all His Enemies, and diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Subjects; though even to them he has done all the Good in this World to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them not to be ſo.</p>
               <p>There is one ſort of theſe, whom the King acknowledges he once thought he ſhould never have had juſt Reaſon to rank among his Enemies. Thoſe Perſons His Majeſty means, who after having well approved their Loyalty to His Glorious Father in the laſt Age of Rebellion, have yet ſince been either wholly perverted,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:37494:119"/>or have very much ſtagger'd in their due Obedience and Love to himſelf.</p>
               <p>For them His Majeſty declares he would fain ſtill retain His wonted Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And if either private Envy, or a too Preſumptuous Value of their old Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſhall have made them entirely to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the many vaſt Benefits and Favours that He, or his Father have ſo liberally conferr'd on them; or if the late ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Rumors of Popery, Slavery, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power ſhall have ſo far prevail'd, as to ſour and corrupt Them alſo; yet they might remember, that their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Loyalty did once before remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, and bravely ſtood the Shock a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the very ſame Rumors and Slanders, as popularly, but as falſly urg'd then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Government, as they have been of late. So that either then they were in the wrong, or are now; and cannot poſſibly have been both times on the right ſide.</p>
               <p>Wherefore His Majeſty conjures them to look back on the Actions of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Lives; and to make the Honour got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by them in their Youth for their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Fidelity to the Crown, firſt a reproof, then an example to their Old Age. Once for all, let them ſeriouſly
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:37494:119"/>obſerve that they are come at laſt to be unfortunately deluded, not only by many the very ſame ill Principles, but alſo by many the very ſame ill Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Men, which they once eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it their Glory and Conſcience to fight againſt.</p>
               <p>But as for all who ſtill continue the Kings Faithful Friends and Dutiful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, His Majeſty moſt willingly takes this occaſion to ſpeak to them in another Style. His Majeſty cannot but teſtifie to all the World the delightful ſenſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of their unmoveable Steddineſs and renew'd Fidelity to him, in theſe late times of extreme difficulty and diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He cannot ſuppreſs within his own Royal Breaſt his Joy, to find the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken Principles and Practices of Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to his Bleſſed Father, ſtill ſurviving and flouriſhng in them, and inherited by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with increaſe.</p>
               <p>And after the unvaluable Mercy of God to him and his Subjects in his moſt happy Reſtoration, His Majeſty cannot but eſteem This to have been equall'd by none but That; that, in ſo dangerous a Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Publick Affairs, he has met with ſo many unfeign'd Teſtimonies of Love to his Perſon and Zeal for his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:37494:120"/>from all Degrees of Men in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And if ſome have ſwerv'd from their Duty, yet His Majeſties Indignation and Reſentments againſt them are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd by the comfortable remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the far greater and better Number of thoſe who ſtood by him in the ſevereſt Trials.</p>
               <p>So His Majeſty has juſt reaſon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, the main Body of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Gentry has done: So has the whole ſound and honeſt Part of the Commonalty: So the great Fountains of Knowledge and Civility, the Two Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities: So the wiſeſt, and moſt Learned in the Laws: So the whole Clergy, and all the Genuine Sons of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> A Church whoſe Glory it is, to have been never tainted with the leaſt Blemiſh of Diſloyalty.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty cannot here forbear to let the World know, what entire Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction he has taken in one ſpecial Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his Subjects Affections; whence through Gods Gracious Providence the Monarchy has gain'd a moſt conſiderable Advantage, by means of this very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy; And it is, that ſo great a Number of the Cities and Corporations of this
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:37494:120"/>Kingdom, have ſince ſo freely reſign'd their Local Immunities and Charters into His Majeſties Hands; leſt the abuſe of any of them ſhould again hereafter prove hazardous to the juſt Prerogatives of the Crown.</p>
               <p>This His Majeſty declares he eſteems as the peculiar Honour of his Reign; being ſuch, as none of the moſt popular of all his late Royal Predeceſſors could have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to themſelves, or hoped for. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore His Majeſty thinks himſelf more than ordinarily oblig'd to continue, as he has hitherto begun, to ſhew the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duration and Benignity, in the Exerciſe of ſo great a Truſt: Reſolving upon this occaſion, to convince the higheſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to the Commonweal; that as the Crown was the firſt Original, ſo it is ſtill the ſureſt Guardian of all the Peoples Lawful Rights, and Priviledges.</p>
               <p>In Concluſion His Majeſty makes this ſolemn Declaration to all his Loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: That as by former and late Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, he has found, next under God, the firmneſs of his Friends to him has ſaved his Authority and Life; So he is reſolved to ſecure both, by his Conſtancy to his Friends. Such as was the Old Loyal Party, and as many as have been bred up,</p>
